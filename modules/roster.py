modules/roster.py  v1.2  -  the canonical network list

WHY
    Witnessing runs on each operator's own machine. A new chain can join
    the network and nobody else's server knows it exists, because nobody
    told it. The result is a star with one operator in the middle, which
    is the shape a witnessed log is supposed to avoid.

    This publishes the list. Every peer, every tip URL, one public route.
    A peer's sync reads it and witnesses everyone on it, including
    whoever joined this morning.

    It does not witness anything itself. It is a phone book.

WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM
    witness_log and witness_names, which witness.py already maintains,
    plus signed_keys from signed.py where it exists. Nothing new is
    recorded and no existing module changes. A chain appears here because
    it submitted a tip, which is the same thing that binds its name today.

WHAT MAKES THE LIST HONEST
    Every entry carries its own evidence: when it was first and last
    seen, how many observations, whether its name is bound to a host or
    to a key, and whether it has gone quiet. Nothing is filtered out for
    looking bad. A silent chain stays listed and is marked silent,
    because hiding it would make the list a claim rather than a record.

WHAT CHANGED IN 1.2, AND WHY
    Two things, both prompted by peers reading their own entries.

    1. THE STATUS WORDS NOW MEAN WHAT THE OTHER ROUTE MEANS.
       /x/witness/peers has always used three bands - current under 6h,
       stale from 6 to 48, silent beyond. This route used two, so the
       same peer could read "silent" here and "stale" there in the same
       minute, with no way to tell which was the real one. They now match,
       and both publish what the bands mean.

       The words describe elapsed time since we last recorded an
       observation. Nothing else. A peer who publishes on a human
       schedule rather than a timer reads stale between sessions, and
       that is correct rather than a fault. It is never a claim that
       anyone's endpoint was unavailable, and Philip Pinol (PRAXIS) had
       to point that out from his own seat, which he should not have had
       to do.

    2. THE LIST NOW EXPLAINS ITS OWN VOCABULARY.
       Entries carry liveness and name_status values written by
       witness.py, and signed.py adds two more of them. Publishing a word
       a reader cannot look up is the same failure as "confirmed" was:
       the meaning lives somewhere else and does not travel with the
       record. Every value this route can emit is now defined in the
       response that emits it.
