"""modules/bind.py - the signed lane.

A peer signs their own submission with a credential, so binding rests on
possession of a secret rather than on a fetcher reaching a url.

v1.1.2 (read-side wording only, nothing sealed changes): the bound-state
text said "Only the holder of it can submit under this name." A credential
is a shared secret - this platform holds a copy, and any party the secret
has been disclosed to holds one too - so "only the holder" was guarding an
access control rather than describing a check. Raised by Ishaan (Shango
MID). Same class as the confirmed rename in witness v1.2.

    POST /x/bind/issue      issue a credential for a name   (operator key)
    POST /x/bind/claim      seal a dated claim marker       (operator key)
    POST /x/bind/revoke     revoke a credential             (operator key)
    POST /x/bind/submit     signed tip submission           (signature only)
    GET  /x/bind/name       binding state and history       (public)
    GET  /x/bind/conflicts  every contested name            (public)
