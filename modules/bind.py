modules/bind.py  -  the signed lane

WHAT CHANGED IN 1.1
-------------------
receipt_seq is a real number here now, and it means something.

Until this version this lane returned whatever server.py's seal() gave
back for the sequence, and passed None as the api_key when calling it.
seal() only issues its counter when a key is supplied, because that
counter lives on the api_keys row - so the value was always null. The
field was in the response, named as though it were a receipt sequence,
carrying nothing.

That is not a cosmetic problem. The point of a sequence number is that a
holder of receipts N and N+2 can PROVE N+1 exists and was not received.
A null cannot do that, so this lane had no completeness property at all
while appearing to offer one.

Found on the sibling lane at /x/peer/submit by Philip Pinol (PRAXIS),
whose schema required an integer and got a null. Same fault, same fix,
applied here before anybody hit it: the sequence is issued by this module,
per name, from its own counter, incremented and read inside the SAME lock
hold that writes the submission row. A number is never spent on a
submission that was not stored, and never skipped for one that was.

The server-wide counter is still returned, as key_seq, and is still null.
It is reported rather than omitted so the absence is visible instead of
inferred - which is exactly the confusion that made this worth fixing.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Name binding used to depend on a fetcher reaching a URL and parsing JSON
out of it. Three things were wrong with that and a reviewer found all
three:

  - a page that is reachable but serves HTML does not bind, and the
    platform described it as if it did
  - a name with no binding is claimable by anybody, so a peer who followed
    that description was left one submission away from being squatted
  - the failure text asserted the URL was unreachable, when all the check
    had established was that the response was not JSON. Reachability and
    parseability are two different facts and conflating them put a false
    statement in a sealed block

This module removes the fetcher from the trust path entirely.

A peer signs their own submission with a credential. Binding then rests on
possession of a secret rather than on my crawler reaching anything, parsing
anything, or on my description of what happens when it cannot. Nobody has to
stand up an endpoint whose only purpose is to satisfy someone else's fetcher.

WHAT A SIGNED BINDING PROVES, EXACTLY
-------------------------------------
That whoever submitted holds the credential issued for that name, on the date
it was issued, and that the submission has not been altered since signing.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
----------------------
That they own the domain. That they are who the name suggests. That anything
in their chain is true. A credential is a shared secret between two parties
and nothing more - it makes a name unstealable, not a claim honest. Domain
control is a separate check this module does not perform and does not imply.

    POST /x/bind/issue      issue a credential for a name   (operator key)
    POST /x/bind/claim      seal a dated claim marker       (operator key)
