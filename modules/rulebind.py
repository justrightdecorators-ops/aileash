"""
modules/rulebind.py  -  rule binding, provable without an account

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
-------------------------
Eighteen months after a decision, nobody asks what was decided. They ask which
rules were live at that instant. Most systems answer with a changelog somebody
could have edited, or with a version number sitting beside the record rather
than inside it - which proves nothing, because anything beside a record can be
changed afterwards to suit.

The claim worth making is narrower and harder: the ruleset version was
committed at the moment of the decision, in the same sealed object, and a
verdict cannot later be reattributed to different rules.

HOW IT IS PROVED WITHOUT TRUSTING US
------------------------------------
Every decision here produces a binding digest:

    AILEASH-RULEBIND-v1|<pack_id>|<pack_hash>|<inputs_digest>|<verdict>|<score>|<sealed_at>

SHA-256 of that string is what gets sealed into the chain. Every component is
published. So anyone can take the components we return, rebuild the string
themselves, hash it, and check it equals the binding in the sealed record.

That is the whole proof, and it works in both directions:

  - change the pack hash after the fact and the binding no longer recomputes
  - change the binding and the chain breaks from that block onwards
  - change the chain and it stops matching the external anchor and the peer
    chain that recorded our tip an hour later

None of those require taking our word for anything, and none require us to
disclose the scoring logic - the inputs are published as a digest, not as
values, and the weights are never exposed at any point.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
----------------------
That the rules were good ones. That the verdict was correct. That the pack
does what its description says. It proves which ruleset produced which verdict
and that the pairing was fixed at the time rather than asserted later. Narrow,
and the only part that is actually provable.

ROUTES  (all public - the point is that no account is needed)
------------------------------------------------------------
  POST /x/rulebind/prove       run a decision, get every component back
  GET  /x/rulebind/verify?receipt=   recompute the binding for a sealed record
  GET  /x/rulebind/packs       ruleset versions and when each was first sealed
  GET  /x/rulebind/spec        what this proves and what it does not
