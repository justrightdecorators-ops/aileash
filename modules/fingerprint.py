"""
modules/fingerprint.py  -  is somebody else running my scoring function?

THE IDEA
--------
The scoring engine is deterministic. Identical inputs give an identical score,
every time, forever. That is a compliance property - and it is also a
signature.

So: fire a fixed battery of carefully chosen inputs at any scoring endpoint,
fire the same battery at our own, and compare the two sets of numbers.

  identical across 24 varied vectors        it is this function
  identical shape, different scale          it is this function, reweighted
  same ordering, different curve            similar design, not this code
  unrelated                                 unrelated

WHY THE VECTORS ARE CHOSEN THE WAY THEY ARE
-------------------------------------------
Random inputs would only catch a straight copy. These are picked to probe the
specific design decisions in the function, because those are what survive
someone renaming things or nudging a weight:

  saturation points   velocity terms saturate at different counts per window,
                      so a burst and a grind separate. Vectors sit either side
                      of each saturation point.
  curve shape         amount is log-scaled, so small sums move the score far
                      more than large ones. Vectors walk that curve.
  normalisation       the continuous weights sum to 1.00 and the boolean
                      geography terms sit outside it. Vectors isolate that.
  asymmetry           trust contributes inversely and dominates. Vectors sweep
                      trust alone with everything else held flat.

A copy that renamed every field and changed nothing else matches exactly. A
copy that shifted the weights still tracks the shape, because the saturation
points and the log curve are structural rather than parametric.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO
-----------------
It only sees endpoints it can reach. A private product behind a key with no
free tier is invisible to this, and no amount of cleverness changes that.

It also proves similarity, never theft. Two people can converge on similar
weights honestly. What this produces is a dated, sealed measurement - which is
evidence, not a verdict, and the distinction matters if it is ever put in
front of anyone.

EVERY RUN IS SEALED
-------------------
The probe, the target, the vectors and the result all go into the chain. So a
comparison run today is provable as having been run today, rather than
assembled afterwards to fit an argument.

ROUTES  (all keyed - this is not a public toy)
----------------------------------------------
  POST /x/fingerprint/self      score the battery on our own engine
  POST /x/fingerprint/probe     url, plus optional field mapping. Compare.
  GET  /x/fingerprint/history   previous probes and their verdicts
  GET  /x/fingerprint/vectors   the battery itself
  GET  /x/fingerprint/spec      what a verdict means and does not mean
