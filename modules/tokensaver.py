sebbi.pro - the token saver

Reached at /x/tokensaver/<action>.

WHAT IT IS
----------
A deterministic gate that sits in front of a model and decides, in
arithmetic alone, whether a request is answered from store, sent to the
model, sent to a cheaper one, held for a person, or refused.

It also tells the caller, on every single request, exactly what in that
request is costing money that it does not need to cost.

Every decision seals into the platform chain. The saving is a receipt,
not a claim.

HOW IT IS BUILT
---------------
Three layers, in this order, because a cost gate that depends entirely
on tuned weights is a cost gate nobody can defend in a meeting.

  Layer 1  HARD RULES
           Absolute, arithmetic, untunable. A budget that is spent is
           spent. A request repeating identically eight times is a
           runaway. These do not consult the score at all.

  Layer 2  THE SCORE
           Nine weighted signals summing to exactly 1.00, split into
           the ones that measure what this request will SPEND and the
           ones that measure whether that spend is WASTE.

  Layer 3  FINDINGS
           Named, itemised waste inside the request, each with a token
           figure attached and each marked exact or estimated. This is
           the part that saves the most money, because it changes what
           the caller sends next time.

THREE TIERS OF CERTAINTY, NEVER MIXED
-------------------------------------
  tokens_not_bought          EXACT. Provider-reported counts on a
                             request that was served from store.
                             This is the only number that goes in a
                             savings total.

  worst_case_tokens_avoided  A CEILING, not a saving. When a request
                             is refused, max_tokens tells you the most
                             it could have cost. Reported separately
                             and never added to the exact figure.

  findings tokens            ESTIMATED where marked. Character counts
                             divided by four. Never enters any total.

Nothing on this page is ever expressed as a percentage saved.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
- It never calls a model to reach a decision. Every signal is
  arithmetic on the request itself.
- It only serves a stored answer for an IDENTICAL request. Matching
  similar prompts needs an embedding, which is a model call, which
  would defeat the entire point.
- It does not judge whether a stored answer is still correct.
- It does not store answers to requests that asked for varied output,
  unless the caller overrides that deliberately.
