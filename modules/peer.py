modules/peer.py  v1.1  --  signed peer submission (shared secret)

READ THIS FIRST: WHAT THIS LANE BINDS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
    This lane authenticates with HMAC-SHA256 over a shared secret.

    A shared secret is held by BOTH parties. So a valid signature proves
    the submission came from someone holding that secret -- which is the
    peer, and also the operator of this deployment.

        It closes third-party submission under your name.
        It does NOT close operator submission under your name.

    That is a normal property of HMAC and not a defect. It is stated here,
    at the top, because "signed" reads stronger than it is, and a peer
    choosing between lanes should not have to work that out for
    themselves. Raised by Ishaan (Shango MID), who was right.

    If you need the operator excluded as well, use /x/signed/submit
    instead. There you generate an Ed25519 keypair, keep the private half,
    and this deployment holds only the public half -- so it can verify a
    signature and can never produce one. That property is arithmetic
    rather than a promise about our conduct.

    Both lanes stay open. This one is simpler to implement and costs the
    peer no key custody, which is a real advantage if a long-lived private
    key is a liability you would rather not carry. The other is stronger.
    Pick deliberately.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    /x/witness/observe is unauthenticated on purpose. Anyone can submit a
    tip without an account, and that openness is what answers the
    collusion objection -- nobody has to trust us to audit the network.

    The cost of that openness is that anyone can submit a tip under any
    name. Name binding catches most of it; it does not prevent it.

    A named peer exchanging period roots wants a stronger guarantee than
    the open endpoint gives. This module provides one WITHOUT changing the
    open endpoint. All three run side by side.

WHAT IT COVERS
    canonicalization, HMAC-SHA256 signing, nonce, replay window, clock
    skew, idempotency, retry semantics, suspension, key rotation with
    overlap.

AUTH LIVES IN THE BODY, NOT IN HEADERS
    The module router hands modules a parsed body, not the raw headers,
    so every authentication field travels in the JSON body. This also
    makes the scheme trivial to implement from any language and easy to
    replay in a test.

THE SCHEME, IN FULL
    Envelope:
        {
          "peer_id":         "prae-001",
          "ts":              1755432000,          integer unix seconds
          "nonce":           "<>=16 chars, unique per peer>",
          "idempotency_key": "<optional, <=128 chars>",
          "payload":         { ... the thing being submitted ... },
          "signature":       "<hex hmac-sha256>"
        }

    THOSE FIELDS AND NO OTHERS. The server rebuilds the envelope from the
    known field names before checking the signature, so any extra
    top-level field you signed will not be part of what we verify and the
    signature will not match. Put anything of your own inside payload.
    This trips people up and now it is written down.

    String to sign:
        "AILEASH-PEER-v1\\n" + canonical(envelope_without_signature)

    canonical() is exactly:
        json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"),
                   ensure_ascii=True)

    signature = hmac_sha256(secret, string_to_sign).hexdigest()

    POST /x/peer/canonical returns the exact string to sign for a given
    envelope, so an implementer can debug canonicalization without
    holding or revealing a secret.

RULES
    clock skew      +/- 300s. Outside that: 401 clock_skew.
    nonce           unique per peer for 900s. Reused: 409 replay.
    idempotency     same key + same payload digest returns the FIRST
                    response verbatim, sealed once. Same key + different
                    payload: 409 idempotency_conflict.
    retry           safe. Retry the identical envelope; idempotency makes
                    it a no-op that returns the original receipt.
    suspension      403 peer_suspended. Submissions refused, nothing
                    deleted, the peer's history stands.
    rotation        two secrets live at once. A new secret is issued and
                    the previous one stays valid for ROTATION_OVERLAP
                    (default 24h) so a peer can roll without downtime.

                    Note the asymmetry with the other lane: here the
                    OPERATOR issues and rotates the secret, because the
                    operator holds it too. At /x/signed/rotate the peer
                    rotates their own key and the operator cannot, because
                    a rotation must be signed by the key being replaced.

ROUTES
    GET  spec       public   full implementation guide
    POST canonical  public   the exact string to sign. no secret needed.
    GET  peers      public   peer ids, status, rotation state. no secrets.
    POST submit     public route, SIGNATURE authenticated
    POST register   keyed    operator issues a peer credential
    POST rotate     keyed    issue a new secret, overlap the old
    POST suspend    keyed
    POST resume     keyed
    GET  history    keyed    submissions by peer
