Reconciliation notary - /x/reconcile/<action>

THE PROBLEM THIS ATTACKS
------------------------
A sealed chain proves records were not altered after the fact. It does not
prove they were true when written. An operator who seals fiction on time has
a tamper-evident chain of fiction. Every honest person in this market knows
that, and almost nobody says it.

You cannot prove truth from outside a system. What you CAN do is what real
auditors do: substantive testing. Take the sealed claim, go to the operator's
own live system, and check whether the two agree - then seal the result of
that check, including the failures.

WHY THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT
-------------------------
The sample is fixed before the operator sees it.

/plan derives a selection seed from the current chain tip - a value the
operator cannot predict in advance and cannot change afterwards without
breaking the chain - picks the records to be tested, and seals that selection
BEFORE any data is requested. Only then are the record identifiers returned.

So the operator cannot choose which records get examined, cannot prepare only
the flattering ones, and cannot quietly drop a test that came back badly:
every planned run is sealed at the moment it is planned, and a plan with no
submitted result is visible forever as an abandoned test.

Mismatches are sealed with the same permanence as matches. That is the whole
design. A reconciliation system that can bury its own failures is decoration.

WHAT A PASS ACTUALLY MEANS
--------------------------
That two systems the operator controls agree with each other, on records the
operator could not choose, at a time the operator could not pick.

That is not proof of truth. An operator who fabricates consistently across
every system, in real time, without knowing what will be sampled, will pass.
What it does is raise the cost of lying from "edit one database" to
"maintain a coherent parallel reality across independent systems indefinitely,
under unpredictable sampling, with every failure sealed permanently."

That is the honest claim. It is also, as far as I know, more than anyone else
in this market is doing.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
- Consistency is not truth. Two agreeing systems can both be wrong.
- The operator supplies the comparison data. This tests their systems against
  each other, not against the world.
- Sampling only covers what has been sealed. It cannot find a decision that
  was never recorded at all - gapless receipts are what cover that.
- A high match rate on a badly chosen field proves nothing. Reconcile the
  fields that would hurt to get wrong.
