WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
This script takes a bundle and reaches its own conclusion using nothing but
the Python standard library. It does not call the issuing system, it does not
import anything you have to install, and it does not take a single field of
the bundle at face value.

It does four separate things, and each one can fail on its own:

  1. SIGNATURE   Ed25519 over the canonical bundle. Confirms the bundle came
                 from the holder of the named key and has not been edited by
                 anybody since.

  2. INTEGRITY   Recomputes every grant digest, the lineage digest and the
                 parameter digest from the fields in front of it. Confirms
                 the bundle is internally consistent with its own contents.

  3. DERIVATION  Re-runs the authority rules from scratch: root issued by a
                 human, an unbroken parent chain, scope covered at every hop,
                 constraints narrowing on every axis, purpose narrowing,
                 validity windows contained, nothing revoked, and the action
                 itself inside the effective limits of the whole lineage.

  4. AGREEMENT   Compares the verdict this script reached with the verdict the
                 bundle claims. Disagreement is reported as a failure of the
                 issuer, not of this script.

WHAT A PASS MEANS
-----------------
That the authority for this action was derivable, at that time, from that
human grant - or, for a refusal, that it genuinely was not, and that the named
grant and invariant really are where it broke.

WHAT A PASS DOES NOT MEAN
-------------------------
That the root grant should ever have been issued. That the parameters describe
something that really happened. That the risk engine was right. Derivation is
not merit and it is not truth.

The risk half of a composed verdict cannot be re-derived here, because that
needs the issuer's scoring engine. Where the bundle's authority verdict is
BLOCK, the composed verdict stands regardless, because the composition takes
the worse of the two.

THE SIGNED MATERIAL
-------------------
Exactly one field is removed before checking: signature. Everything else the
bundle carries, including verify_with, is inside the signature, which is what
the bundle's own instruction says. A verifier that quietly strips more fields
than the published method does is checking a different document from the one
the issuer told the world to check.
