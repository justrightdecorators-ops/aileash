modules/complete.py  -  proving what ISN'T there
================================================

THE PROBLEM NOBODY IN THIS MARKET ANSWERS
-----------------------------------------
A hash chain proves inclusion. It cannot prove exclusion.

So when a firm hands an auditor four hundred decisions, nothing on earth
shows it wasn't six hundred. Every audit ever conducted runs on the
assumption that the sample handed over is the whole set, and that
assumption has never once been provable. The chain says "these four
hundred happened". It says nothing about the two hundred that also
happened and quietly didn't make the export.

Three questions follow, and none of them can be answered by an
append-only log on its own:

  1. Is this the complete set, or the flattering subset?
  2. Do you hold a record about me? Prove the NO.
  3. You erased my data - prove it, without holding my data to prove it.

Question 3 is the contradiction sitting inside every
blockchain-for-compliance product, this one included. Append-only and
right-to-erasure do not obviously coexist. Most vendors disclaim it.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
At the end of each period we take every leaf sealed in that period, SORT
them, build a Merkle tree over the sorted list, and seal the root plus the
exact count into the chain. That root is then anchored externally like
everything else.

Sorting is the whole trick. In an unsorted tree you can only prove a leaf
is present. In a sorted one you can prove a leaf is absent, by showing the
two leaves either side of where it would have sorted and proving they are
ADJACENT in the tree. Nothing can sit between two adjacent leaves. The
record provably does not exist.

  INCLUSION     standard Merkle path. This receipt is in the period.
  ABSENCE       the two neighbours, and proof they are adjacent. No record
                for that key exists in the period, and we cannot pretend
                otherwise after the fact.
  COMPLETENESS  the count was sealed BEFORE anyone asked for anything.
                Hand over four hundred against a root that says six
                hundred and the arithmetic exposes it.

ERASURE
-------
Erasing a record deletes the payload and leaves the leaf as a tombstone.
We can then prove: a record existed, it was erased, and when - while
holding none of the erased content. The subject gets a proof of erasure
rather than a promise of one, and the chain does not have to be broken to
give it to them.

WHY COMMITMENTS ARE FROZEN
--------------------------
A commitment is only worth anything if it cannot be recomputed to suit
later circumstances. So:

  - Only CLOSED periods can be committed. You cannot commit a period that
    is still running, because more leaves could still arrive.
  - The sorted leaf list is STORED at commit time, not recomputed on
    demand. If rows are erased next year, the proofs from this year still
    verify against the root that was sealed and anchored this year.
  - A period can only be committed once. A second attempt returns the
    existing commitment rather than a new root.

WHY COMMITTING IS AUTOMATIC
---------------------------
It was not, and that was a real hole rather than an oversight worth
defending. Committing was a keyed POST somebody had to remember to make,
which meant that for the first week of publication this module had zero
committed periods while the discovery document advertised completeness and
absence as publicly demonstrable checks. Both were true claims about code
that existed and false claims about anything an outsider could run.

A control that depends on the operator remembering to run it is the exact
control an auditor should distrust, so the schedule now runs itself. Once
a month closes, the first request to reach this module commits it.

Two honest limits on that:

  - The automatic commitment is DEPLOYMENT-WIDE. It covers every record
    sealed in the period regardless of which key sealed it, because that
    is what a public completeness claim has to mean. Per-tenant
    commitments are still made by POSTing /x/complete/commit with that
    tenant's key, and the two live side by side.
  - A period committed late is committed at the date it was actually
    committed, and /x/complete/periods reports the gap in days. Backfilled
    history still proves the count was fixed before any export was asked
    for. It does not prove the count was fixed when the period closed, and
    nothing published here will claim it does.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
  - This proves completeness of what was SEALED. A decision that never
    reached the chain at all is outside anything we can see. Garbage in
    still applies; what changes is that the operator can no longer choose
    which of the sealed records to show.
  - Absence proofs are scoped to a period. "No record of you, ever"
    means checking every period, which is why the period list is public.
  - The tree is built over key material only. It never contains payloads,
    so a leaf reveals whether something exists, not what it said.
  - Adjacent-leaf absence proofs disclose the two neighbouring keys. If
    keys are themselves sensitive, hash them before they become leaves -
    the proof still works, and we hold nothing legible.

Conformance testing - /x/conformance/<action>

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
Three limits are documented elsewhere in this platform, and all three have
the same shape: the engine's arithmetic is sound, but the guarantee depends
on something outside the engine.

  1. Commit-before-reveal proves order - but only if the integrator does not
     show its reviewers the machine verdict before calling /open.
  2. Mutual witnessing gets its strength from breadth - two platforms
     witnessing only each other prove very little.
  3. A declaration is only as strong as the rules declared - one that
     constrains nothing passes everything.

None of these can be fixed by the engine on its own. All three can be
MEASURED, and a measured weakness is a different animal from an unmeasured
one. That is what this module does.

1. PROBES - testing the integration, not trusting it
----------------------------------------------------
The idea is borrowed openly from how real audits work, and specifically from
a point James Stokes made publicly: slip a case with a known answer into the
queue, unannounced, and see who catches it.

A probe creates a genuine oversight case whose machine verdict is
deliberately set to a known-wrong value. The reviewer sees it exactly like
any other case. Two things then follow:

  - If they agree with the deliberately wrong verdict, they did not evaluate
    it. That is a caught rubber stamp, sealed.
  - If the integration is showing them the verdict before /open is called,
    their probe agreement rate will match their normal agreement rate. If
    they are genuinely deciding blind, it will not. The gap between the two
    numbers is the conformance signal.

A single probe proves nothing about a person. A catch rate across dozens is
evidence about a process, which is the thing under audit.

2. WITNESS BREADTH - concentration is visible
---------------------------------------------
Reports how many distinct peers witness the chain, how concentrated the
observations are in the largest peer, and how many peers have gone quiet.
Below three live peers the network is reported as weak, because it is.

3. DECLARATION STRENGTH - rules that never fire
------------------------------------------------
Runs the live declaration against sealed records and reports, per rule, how
many records it actually CONSTRAINED - that is, how many matched its `when`
condition and therefore had to satisfy its `require`. A rule that has never
constrained a single record is not a standard. It is decoration, and it is
named as such.

HONEST LIMITS OF THIS MODULE
----------------------------
- Probes test the process, not any individual. Someone can catch a probe and
  still rubber stamp the next hundred cases.
- A determined integrator who identifies probe cases can treat them
  differently. Probe case references are not marked in any way the reviewer
  can see, but a sufficiently motivated operator controls their own UI.
- Breadth and strength are measurements, not enforcement. Nothing here can
  compel a platform to witness widely or declare strictly. It can only make
  the alternative visible.

"""
modules/consistency.py  -  proving we have never run two histories
==================================================================

THE ATTACK NOTHING ELSE HERE STOPS
----------------------------------
Mutual witnessing means several parties hold hashes of our chain. What
none of them can currently check is whether they are all holding hashes of
the SAME chain.

Nothing in the design so far stops an operator running two histories in
parallel. Serve chain A to one witness, chain B to an auditor. Both get a
valid-looking tip. Both anchor it. Both verify perfectly against the copy
they were given. Neither can tell, because there is no way to ask the
question that would expose it:

    is the tip you are holding actually an ancestor of my current head?

That is the split-view attack. Witnessing does not stop it. Anchoring does
not stop it - two forks can both be anchored. It is the last place an
operator can lie, and it is the one nobody in compliance has closed,
because the defence came out of Certificate Transparency and has not
crossed over.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Builds an ordered Merkle tree over the audit chain and answers one
question for anybody, forever, without our cooperation:

    GET /x/consistency/ancestor?tip=<any tip we ever served>

If that tip is on our chain, we return its position and a proof, against
our current head, that it is still there and still in the same place. If
it is not on our chain, we say so - and the party holding it knows they
were served a history we no longer stand behind.

Every witness can check every tip they have ever held, automatically, on a
timer, for as long as they keep the tips. Which means we cannot show two
faces to the network: the moment any holder of any old tip checks it, a
fork stops being hidden and becomes provable arithmetic.

APPEND-ONLY, PROVED RATHER THAN ASSERTED
----------------------------------------
    GET /x/consistency/proof?first=21&second=48

Proves the log at size 21 is a PREFIX of the log at size 48. Not that both
exist - that the second was reached from the first by appending only, with
nothing inserted, removed or reordered in between. That is the actual
meaning of "append-only", and until now it has been a claim rather than
something a stranger could check.

WHY THE MATHS IS BORROWED, NOT INVENTED
---------------------------------------
The tree here follows RFC 6962 - Certificate Transparency - deliberately,
including its leaf and node prefixes and its split at the largest power of
two. Anyone who has implemented a CT verifier can point it at this and it
will work. Inventing a bespoke tree would mean nobody could check us
without writing new code first, which is the opposite of the point.

Note this tree is ORDERED, unlike the sorted tree in modules/complete.py.
The two answer different questions. Sorted proves what is absent. Ordered
proves nothing was reordered. They are not interchangeable and both are
needed.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
  - This proves our published chain is internally append-only and that a
    given tip belongs to it. It says nothing about whether an entry should
    have been written in the first place.
  - A fork is only DETECTED if someone actually checks a tip they were
    given. The network has to do its half. That is why the route is public
    and needs no account - so checking costs nothing and can be automated.
  - If nobody ever holds an old tip of ours, there is nothing to check us
    against. Detection scales with how many witnesses keep history, which
    is another reason breadth matters more than depth.
  - Recomputation is O(n) hashing over the chain. Cached per size. On a
    very large log a checkpoint-based approach would be better; that is
    written down rather than hidden.

    GET  /x/consistency/root         current size and root      (public)
    GET  /x/consistency/ancestor     is this tip on our chain    (public)
    GET  /x/consistency/proof        prefix proof between sizes  (public)
