"""modules/bind.py - the signed lane.

A peer signs their own submission with a credential, so binding rests on
possession of a secret rather than on a fetcher reaching a url.

v1.2.0 - block indices now carry their chain epoch.

A block_index on its own is not a reference. The chain restarted from
genesis on 7 September 2026, and an index issued before that became wrong
in the last day - not dangling, but resolving to a real, correctly-sealed
block belonging to someone else, as the chain grew past it. A dangling
pointer announces itself. A pointer that quietly lands on another party's
record does not.

So: every row this module writes from now on records the genesis hash of
the chain it was sealed under, and every route publishing an index says
which epoch it belongs to and whether that epoch is still current. Rows
written before this version have no epoch recorded and cannot be given
one retroactively - inventing it would be the same fault one step back -
so they publish as epoch unknown with the index marked unresolvable
against this chain. Raised by Ishaan (Shango MID), whose own rule is that
a grant carries the epoch it was decided under and is refused when the
epoch has moved.

modules/binddesk.py  -  buttons for the signed lane

modules/bind.py is the engine. It answers POST requests with a key, which is
correct and completely unusable from a phone: a browser address bar can only
send GET, and nothing in it can attach an Authorization header.

So this is the page. Paste the key once, tap a button. Same routes underneath,
nothing new in the trust path.

Served at /bind-desk by the same runtime do_GET patch console.py uses. The
page holds nothing - the key is typed in, kept in the tab, and sent on each
request. Every route it calls checks that key itself.

PUBLIC is empty. Nothing here is reachable without a key except the page
itself, and the page is inert until one is pasted into it.

# patch that only runs once this module is touched, and every other route here

```python
"""
modules/blocks.py  v1.0.1
=========================
Paged reads of the audit chain, for the command centre.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
/admin/audit calls verify_chain() on every single request. That rewalks and
rehashes every block in the chain while holding the database lock, so the
cost of asking for twenty rows is the cost of re-verifying the whole log.
On a single replica that hold is long enough for Railway to decide the app
has stopped responding, and the container gets killed -- which also wipes
the in-memory admin tokens, so the next call comes back 401.

This module does the one thing the block view actually needs: read rows.
No verification, no rehashing, no full-table walk. Verification stays where
it belongs, on its own route, run deliberately.

WHAT IT ADDS
------------
offset. /admin/audit has no offset and caps at 1000, so nothing older than
the newest thousand blocks could ever be reached. This pages through the
entire chain, oldest to newest or newest to oldest, in small bites.

v1.0.1 -- THE COMMENT WAS WRONG, SO THE CODE IS NOW RIGHT
---------------------------------------------------------
v1.0 said column names were read from the live schema so a future ALTER TABLE
could not silently break it. They were not. The SELECT was hardcoded and rows
were unpacked by position, r[0] through r[5], with the discovered column set
passed into the row shaper and never used. Renaming or reordering a column
would have 500'd every route.

Now it genuinely does what it said: PRAGMA table_info picks the real column
names once, each candidate is resolved against what actually exists, rows come
back as dicts keyed by name, and a missing column is reported in /status
instead of surfacing as a query error later. Same discipline complete.py uses.

ROUTES
------
  GET  /x/blocks/status                       module state, row count, schema
  GET  /x/blocks/list?limit=&offset=&order=   a page of blocks
  GET  /x/blocks/get?seq=                     one block in full
  GET  /x/blocks/around?seq=&span=            a window either side of a block
  GET  /x/blocks/links?limit=&offset=         link check over a page only
  GET  /x/blocks/spec                         what this serves

Every route is keyed. Audit rows are not public.

LINK CHECKING
-------------
/links checks prev_hash against the preceding row's audit_hash across the
page you asked for, and nothing else. It reports which pairs it compared so
a caller can never mistake a clean page for a clean chain. Whole-chain
verification is /api/verify-chain and is deliberately not duplicated here.

One-button decision capture - /x/capture/<action>

WHAT IT IS
----------
A drop-in button for an operator's own review screen. A human reviews an AI
output, clicks once, and the decision is sealed into the chain with who
reviewed it, on what device, against which inputs, and how long they took.

WHY IT IS TWO CALLS AND NOT ONE
-------------------------------
The obvious version is a single POST carrying a dwell time measured in the
browser. That number is the whole point - it is what makes rubber stamping
visible - and a number the reviewed party computes for itself is not
evidence. Anyone can set it to whatever looks diligent.

So the widget opens a case first. The server records the open time. When the
reviewer commits, the server computes the dwell itself from two timestamps it
owns. The browser never supplies the figure it is being judged on.

Same reason the verdict is withheld between the two calls: the machine's
answer is sealed at open and only returned at seal, so the chain shows the
human committed before they saw it. Ordering is the one thing that separates
judgement from agreement.

KEYS IN BROWSERS
----------------
An API key pasted into page JavaScript is public. Anyone reading the source
can post as that operator, forever.

So capture accepts a CAPTURE TOKEN: minted server-side by the operator from
their real key, bound to one origin, short-lived, and able to do exactly two
things - open a case and seal it. It cannot read records, cannot see other
cases, cannot touch any other module. Same idea as a publishable key.

The real API key still works for server-to-server calls. It should never
appear in a page.

DEVICES ARE THE BILLING UNIT
----------------------------
Every capture carries a device_id, and distinct devices per calendar month is
what billing is counted on. The registry here is that count: first seen, last
seen, events, per month. An operator can query their own figure at any time
and reconcile it against an invoice, rather than being told a number.

Device identifiers are hashed on arrival. The chain and the registry hold a
fingerprint, never the raw identifier.

    POST /x/capture/token     mint a browser-safe capture token (real key only)
    POST /x/capture/open      start a case, server records the clock
    POST /x/capture/seal      commit a verdict, server computes the dwell
    GET  /x/capture/devices   this month's billable device count
    GET  /x/capture/case?id=  the sealed record of one capture
    GET  /x/capture/summary   dwell and divergence across recent captures

"""
modules/codebase.py  -  dated evidence of what you held, and when
=================================================================

WHAT THIS IS, STATED HONESTLY FIRST
-----------------------------------
This does not prove ownership. Nothing cryptographic can. Ownership of
software is a legal fact established by authorship, company records and
signed assignment - not by a hash.

What it does produce is the evidence that decides most disputes about
software in practice: a dated, tamper-evident, externally anchored record
that a specific person held a specific body of code, in a specific form, at
a specific moment. When two parties later disagree about who had what
first, that is the question a court, a mediator or an investor actually
asks - and it is normally answered with commit dates, which are settable
fields that prove nothing.

This answers it with arithmetic instead.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
    POST /x/codebase/seal

Walks the deployed source tree, hashes every file, builds one manifest root
over all of them, and seals that root - together with a declaration of
authorship you supply - into the chain. From there it is anchored
externally and handed to peer chains like every other block.

Run it again next week and you get a second dated point. Run it on every
deploy and you accumulate a continuous, uneditable record of the codebase
evolving under your hand, which is a far stronger thing than a single
snapshot: a body of work with a history is much harder to dispute than a
file that appeared once.

WHAT THE MANIFEST CONTAINS - AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
-------------------------------------------------
For each file: its path and the SHA-256 of its exact bytes. Nothing else.
No contents leave the server, ever, by any route here. The hashes are
one-way, so the manifest reveals nothing about what the code does; it only
lets you demonstrate later that a file you hold now is byte-identical to
the file you held then.

The manifest route is deliberately KEYED rather than public. Only the root,
the file count and the total byte size are public. A public file listing
would hand an attacker a map of the deployment for no gain - the root is
all a third party needs in order to check a manifest you show them.

Excluded by default and never hashed: version control internals, caches,
databases, and anything that looks like a secret. Sealing a hash of your
own credentials file would be a poor way to protect them.

HOW YOU USE IT IN A DISPUTE
---------------------------
  1. You produce the sealed root, its block index, and the chain's
     external anchor.
  2. You produce your copy of the code.
  3. Anyone recomputes the manifest from your copy - the rules are
     published at /x/codebase/spec - and compares.

If it matches, you demonstrably held exactly that code no later than the
sealing time, and the record of it has not been altered since, because it
is a block in an anchored chain that peers also hold.

WHAT STILL HAS TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE THIS FILE
------------------------------------------
Stated plainly, because a module that let you believe it had settled your
legal position would be doing you harm:

  - Copyright arises on authorship. Sealing evidences it; it does not
    create or register it.
  - If a company operates the platform, the IP needs to sit with the right
    entity in writing, or the position is muddier than it looks.
  - Where two parties have collaborated, the only reliable answer is an
    agreement saying who owns what, signed before it matters rather than
    after.

This module makes the factual record unarguable. The legal position is a
separate job and needs a solicitor, not a hash.

    POST /x/codebase/seal      hash the tree, seal the root      (keyed)
    GET  /x/codebase/manifest  the full file list for a seal     (keyed)
    GET  /x/codebase/history   every seal, with root changes     (public)
    GET  /x/codebase/root      the latest sealed root            (public)
    GET  /x/codebase/spec      how to recompute it yourself      (public)
