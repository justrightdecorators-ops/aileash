modules/standard.py  -  the Ordering Test discovery document for this domain

WHAT IT SERVES
--------------
  GET /.well-known/ordering-test.json   this operator's discovery document
  GET /x/standard/hash                  sha256 of that document
  GET /x/standard/status                what is installed, and honest counts

SHAPE
-----
Deliberately identical to the shape Red Flag AI Pro published first:

    checks: { <name>: { supported, demonstrable_publicly, endpoint, note } }

Two fields, not one, and the second is the better idea. "We built it" and
"you can verify it without an account" are different claims, and most of this
market blurs them. Separating them lets a vendor be honest about having
something real that an outsider still has to take on trust.

WHAT THE HOST HEADER IS DOING HERE
----------------------------------
base_url is derived from the request rather than written into the file. An
earlier draft had the domain hardcoded, which meant any operator running it
would publish somebody else's domain as the source - the opposite of a mirror.
Deriving it means this file can be lifted to any domain and tells the truth
about wherever it is actually running.

EVERY PUBLISHED ENDPOINT MUST WORK AS WRITTEN
---------------------------------------------
An endpoint marked demonstrable_publicly is a promise that a stranger can copy
it out of this document and get an answer. If the route needs a parameter, the
document names that parameter. If a value has to be discovered first, the
document says where to discover it. An endpoint that errors when followed
literally is a failed check, not a documentation detail.

HONESTY RULES THIS FILE FOLLOWS
-------------------------------
  - A check we have not built says supported: false. It does not quietly go
    missing from the document.
  - A check that exists but needs an account says demonstrable_publicly:
    false, however much we would like the tick.
  - runner is null. A runner exists in draft, but the checks have not been
    jointly agreed with the other mirror, so publishing one as though it were
    a settled standard would claim something neither operator has earned yet.

None of that is modesty. A conformance document whose author scores full marks
on the day they publish it is a marketing page.

Live figures for the Proving Ground - /x/stats

Charts on a compliance site are usually decoration. These are not, provided
they show something a visitor could otherwise only take on trust: that the
chain is genuinely growing, that decisions really are distributed across the
thresholds rather than hand-picked, and that people who click through a
review case behave exactly as the oversight argument predicts.

WHAT IS PUBLISHED, AND WHAT IS NOT

Public and no key, because a figure nobody can see proves nothing.

Published: total chain height, hourly block counts, the verdict mix and score
distribution of PUBLIC DEMO decisions only, and dwell times from public review
cases.

Never published: anything scoped to a customer key. No customer verdict mix,
no customer volumes, no per-key anything. A visitor learns how the engine
behaves, not how any operator's business is going. That distinction is the
whole reason this endpoint can be open.

modules/verifier.py  -  hand the verifier out at a URL

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
So the proof bundles at /x/continuity/proof are useless unless somebody can
easily get hold of something that checks them, and telling people to clone a
repository is a gate.

This serves the standalone verifier as a plain file:

    curl -sO https://sebbi.pro/verify-authority.py
    curl -s "https://sebbi.pro/x/continuity/proof?evaluation=e_..." \\
        | python3 verify-authority.py -

The script it hands out has no dependencies and makes no network calls. It
checks the Ed25519 signature, recomputes every digest, re-runs the whole
derivation from the published rules, and reaches its own verdict - then says
so if that verdict disagrees with ours.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
It does not phone home, and this module records nothing about who downloaded
it. A verification tool that reports back to the party being verified is not
a verification tool.

    GET /verify-authority.py   the script
    GET /x/verifier/status     what is installed, and the script's digest

        | python3 verify_authority.py -

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
This script takes a bundle and reaches its own conclusion using nothing but
the Python standard library. It does not call the issuing system, it does not
import anything you have to install, and it does not take a single field of
the bundle at face value.

It does four separate things, and each one can fail on its own:

  1. SIGNATURE   Ed25519 over the canonical bundle. Confirms the bundle came
                 from the holder of the named key and has not been edited by
                 anybody since.

  2. INTEGRITY   Recomputes every grant digest, the lineage digest and the
                 parameter digest from the fields in front of it. Confirms
                 the bundle is internally consistent with its own contents.

  3. DERIVATION  Re-runs the authority rules from scratch: root issued by a
                 human, an unbroken parent chain, scope covered at every hop,
                 constraints narrowing on every axis, purpose narrowing,
                 validity windows contained, nothing revoked, and the action
                 itself inside the effective limits of the whole lineage.

  4. AGREEMENT   Compares the verdict this script reached with the verdict the
                 bundle claims. Disagreement is reported as a failure of the
                 issuer, not of this script.

WHAT A PASS MEANS
-----------------
That the authority for this action was derivable, at that time, from that
human grant - or, for a refusal, that it genuinely was not, and that the named
grant and invariant really are where it broke.

WHAT A PASS DOES NOT MEAN
-------------------------
That the root grant should ever have been issued. That the parameters describe
something that really happened. That the risk engine was right. Derivation is
not merit and it is not truth.

The risk half of a composed verdict cannot be re-derived here, because that
needs the issuer's scoring engine. Where the bundle's authority verdict is
BLOCK, the composed verdict stands regardless, because the composition takes
the worse of the two.

Mutual witness network - /x/witness/<action>

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Every compliance vendor, this one included, holds the evidence about its own
conduct. A hash chain stops anyone else altering it. It does not stop the
operator rebuilding the whole chain from scratch and presenting the result as
history. External anchoring narrows that to "you cannot rewrite anything older
than your last anchor" - which is good, and still not enough.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Platforms witness each other.

Each platform periodically hands its current chain tip to its peers. Each peer
seals that tip into its OWN chain. From that moment the first platform's
history is recorded inside chains it does not control - and those chains are
themselves anchored externally.

To rewrite your own history now, you would need every peer who witnessed you
to rewrite theirs too, in step, and re-anchor all of it. That is not a
technical exercise. That is a conspiracy, and it grows harder with every
platform that joins.

WHY observe IS OPEN
-------------------
A witnessing network that only accepts tips from account holders is not a
witnessing network, it is a customer list. Anyone must be able to hand us a
tip without asking permission. Unauthenticated observations are filed under
ANON_KEY, and the router meters them per client address.

NAMES, AND WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVE ABOUT THEM
------------------------------------------------
The chain name in a submission is self-declared. Anyone can post under any
name. We do not solve that with accounts, because accounts would make the
network closed. We solve it by publishing how strong each claim is, and by
remembering.

Two independent checks run on every submission, and NEITHER of them can
reject it. A submission is always sealed. What changes is what we say about it.

1. LIVENESS - is there a real chain behind this name?
   If the submission carries a url, we fetch it and compare what it serves
   to what was submitted.
     confirmed      the url serves exactly the tip that was submitted
     live           the url serves a valid tip, but a different one. A busy
                    chain moves between submitting and our fetching, so this
                    is normal and honest, not a failure
     self-declared  no url, or we could not reach it, or it served nonsense

   Note what this does and does not prove. It proves the submitter operates
   a live chain producing that data. It does NOT prove they are who they say.
   Anyone running a real chain can point a stolen name at their own url and
   pass this check cleanly.

2. NAME BINDING - is this the same operator as last time?
   The first time a name is seen with a url we can reach, we record that url
   against the name. Every later submission under that name is compared.
     first-use      never seen this name before, binding recorded
     bound          same url as the first time. Same operator, consistently
     conflict       this name has been submitted from a different url than
                    the one it was first bound to

   A conflict is not proof of theft. Operators move hosts. But it is exactly
   the event anyone auditing the network needs to see, and it is recorded
   permanently in our chain rather than resolved quietly by us.

   This is what actually closes name theft. Check 1 alone does not.

SSRF
----
Check 1 makes our server fetch a url chosen by an anonymous stranger. Done
naively that is a hole considerably worse than the one it fixes: it would let
anyone use us to reach services on our own private network, and to bounce
traffic at a third party. So the fetcher only speaks http and https, only on
ports 80 and 443, resolves the hostname first and refuses any address that is
private, loopback, link-local, reserved or multicast, never follows a
redirect, times out fast, and stops reading after a small cap.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
- Witnessing proves a tip EXISTED at a time. It says nothing about whether the
  records behind it are true or complete. Garbage sealed on time is still
  garbage.
- A peer can stop publishing. Gaps are visible, which is the point, but
  nobody can force participation.
- Two colluding platforms witnessing only each other prove very little. The
  guarantee comes from breadth.
- This module does not verify a peer's chain is internally valid. It records
  what they claimed, when, and how well it stood up to checking.
- The liveness fetch resolves a hostname and then fetches it. An attacker
  controlling DNS could answer differently between those two steps. Closing
  that needs the connection pinned to the checked address, which is more
  machinery than this warrants today. It is written down rather than hidden.

    GET  /x/witness/tip                 our current tip, for peers to record
    POST /x/witness/observe             chain, tip, url - we seal their tip

# AI-SAFETY GRADE SCANNER - stdlib version for server.py
# (converted from the FastAPI/httpx draft - no new dependencies)
#
# HOW TO INSTALL - two pastes into server.py:
#
# PASTE 1: everything between "BEGIN FUNCTIONS" and "END FUNCTIONS"
#          goes near your other helper functions (e.g. just above
#          the JURIS_VERSION block).
#
# PASTE 2: everything between "BEGIN ROUTES" and "END ROUTES"
#          goes inside do_GET, as new elif branches alongside the
#          other GET routes (match their indentation: 8 spaces).
#
# Endpoints added:
#   GET /api/aigrade?domain=example.com        -> JSON grade report
#   GET /api/aigrade/badge?domain=example.com  -> embeddable SVG badge
