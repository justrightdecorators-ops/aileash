modules/mutual.py  -  the outbound half of mutual witnessing
============================================================

Why this exists
---------------
modules/witness.py RECEIVES. Other chains hand us their tips and we seal
them. Nothing in the platform currently SENDS our tip anywhere, so right
now we witness other people and nobody witnesses us. This module is the
missing direction.

Drop it in as modules/mutual.py. The router picks it up automatically -
no edits to server.py.

Routes
------
  POST /x/mutual/push      send our current tip to every configured peer
  POST /x/mutual/pull      fetch every peer's tip and seal it into our chain
  POST /x/mutual/sync      pull then push (this is the one to schedule)
  GET  /x/mutual/peers     the configured peers and what happened last time
  GET  /x/mutual/status    last run, next run, whether the timer is alive

Important design note
---------------------
This module does not touch the database or import anything from server.py.
It talks HTTP to routes that are already public - ours and theirs. That
means it cannot corrupt anything, it works no matter how seal() changes,
and every action it takes is one an outsider could audit for themselves.

To read our own tip it calls our own public /x/witness/tip.
To seal a peer's tip it calls our own public /x/witness/observe, which is
already built to record exactly that. So a peer tip we pull is recorded by
the same code path as a peer tip that was pushed to us.

CONCURRENCY - read this before changing it
------------------------------------------
A sync cycle makes two kinds of call, and they are treated differently on
purpose.

  OUTBOUND to other people's hosts (reading their tip, pushing ours) runs
  in parallel. These are the slow ones - we are waiting on somebody else's
  server, and there is no reason to wait on them one at a time. Fifty peers
  now costs roughly what the slowest single peer costs, instead of the sum
  of all fifty.

  INBOUND to our own server (sealing what we pulled) stays sequential. Our
  own process is handling those requests, and firing a burst of them at
  ourselves while we are mid-cycle is asking for trouble - a queue behind a
  single replica at best. The sealing is fast and local anyway, so there is
  nothing to gain by parallelising it and a real risk in doing so.

So: fetch everything at once, then seal one at a time.

BEFORE THIS WORKS
-----------------
1. "observe" must be in the PUBLIC set of modules/witness.py. If it is not,
   this module gets a 401 from our own server, same as Red Flag AI Pro did.
2. After every deploy, the first /x/ request must be a GET - that is what
   installs the POST branch. Opening /x/mutual/peers in a browser does it.

"""
modules/network.py  -  serves the public witness network page

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A TEMPLATE
---------------------------------------
The router hands whatever handle() returns to send_json, so a module cannot
return HTML through it - it would arrive as a JSON string. So this does the
same thing router.py already does for POST: it patches the request handler at
runtime, adds a branch for the page path, and leaves every other path exactly
as it was. The patch is idempotent and lives in memory, so a restart reverts it.

THE SAME CATCH AS THE POST PATCH
--------------------------------
A module is only imported when a request reaches the router. So after every
deploy, one request to /x/network/status has to arrive before /witness works.
Opening /x/network/status in a browser does it. Until then the page path falls
through to whatever the server did before, which is a 404 - not an error page,
just the old behaviour.

If you would rather not patch anything, the same HTML works as a plain file in
static/. This exists because the page then lives with the module it describes
rather than drifting away from it.

ROUTES
------
  GET /witness            the page
  GET /witness.html       same page
  GET /x/network/status   whether the patch is installed (public)

The page itself holds no data. It reads /x/witness/tip and /x/witness/peers
from the browser, same as any other visitor would, so it cannot show anything
a stranger could not verify for themselves.

    <h2>Why this exists</h2>
    <p class="sec-note">Every platform that sells you an audit trail also holds it.</p>
    <p>A hash chain stops anyone else altering the record. It does not stop the operator rebuilding the whole thing and presenting the result as history. Anchoring the chain externally narrows that down — you can't rewrite anything older than your last anchor — and it still leaves the keeper and the checker as the same party.</p>
    <p>Nothing you build alone closes that. Somebody outside has to be holding a copy.</p>
    <p>So each platform here takes the fingerprint of the others' records and seals it into its own. To rewrite your past now, everyone holding a copy would have to rewrite theirs in step, and re-obtain external timestamps that were issued days ago. The second half is the part that can't be done.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What the marks mean</h2>
    <p class="sec-note">Two checks run on every submission. Neither can reject one — everything gets sealed. What changes is how strong we say the claim is.</p>

    <dl class="defs">
      <div class="def"><dt><span class="dot ok"></span>Confirmed</dt><dd>We fetched the address given and it served exactly the tip that was submitted.</dd></div>
      <div class="def"><dt><span class="dot mid-c"></span>Live</dt><dd>The address served a valid but different tip. A working chain moves between submitting and our looking — normal, not a failure.</dd></div>
      <div class="def"><dt><span class="dot weak"></span>Self-declared</dt><dd>No address given, or we couldn't reach it. Taken on their word, and marked as such.</dd></div>
      <div class="def"><dt>First-use</dt><dd>First time this name appeared. It's now bound to the address it came from.</dd></div>
      <div class="def"><dt>Bound</dt><dd>Same address as the first time this name appeared. The same operator, consistently.</dd></div>
      <div class="def"><dt>Conflict</dt><dd>This name has been submitted from a different address than the one it was first bound to. Still sealed, permanently flagged. Operators do move hosts — but you get to see it and decide.</dd></div>

  <section>
    <h2>What this does not prove</h2>
    <p class="sec-note">Said plainly, because the value of the rest depends on it.</p>
    <ul class="limits">
      <li><b>It doesn't prove a record was true when it was written.</b> Nothing can. No system reaches back to verify what someone was thinking or whether the data going in was honest. This proves what was recorded, when, and that it hasn't changed since.</li>
      <li><b>It doesn't prove identity.</b> A name is self-declared. Checking the address proves someone runs a live chain producing that data — not that they're who they say. Binding a name to its first address is what makes a change visible.</li>
      <li><b>Two platforms checking each other isn't much of a network.</b> The strength comes from breadth. This gets meaningfully harder to bend with every chain that joins, and not before.</li>
      <li><b>A participant can go quiet.</b> Nobody can force anyone to keep publishing. Gaps show up as stale or silent rather than disappearing, which is the point.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Joining</h2>
    <p class="sec-note">Chains submit their current head to the network and record the heads of others in return.</p>
    <pre><span class="k">POST</span> https://sebbi.pro/x/witness/observe
<span class="k">Content-Type:</span> application/json

{
  "chain": "your-chain-name",
  "tip":   "&lt;64 hex characters — your current chain head&gt;",
  "url":   "https://yoursite/your/tip",
  "ts":    "2026-08-02T14:00:00Z"
}</pre>
    <p><code>url</code> is the address we fetch to check your tip independently — it's the difference between confirmed and self-declared. <code>ts</code> is optional, epoch or ISO.</p>
    <p>Running a chain in the other direction, recording ours as we record yours, is what makes it mutual rather than us keeping a list. If you operate a platform in this space and you're willing to have your history held somewhere you don't control, message me and we'll talk through it and what it costs.</p>

Human oversight notary - /x/oversight/<action>

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Nobody can prove a person thought about a decision. That is an internal state
and no amount of logging reaches it. Any vendor claiming to prove genuine
human oversight is overselling.

But rubber stamping is not an internal state. It is a pattern, and patterns
leave marks - if you record the right things, in the right order, at the time.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Three things, none of which claim to read minds.

1. ORDER. The reviewer's own call is sealed BEFORE the machine's verdict is
   revealed to them. Two blocks, in that order, in a chain that cannot be
   reordered afterwards. So a reviewer cannot have simply agreed with an
   answer they had already seen - the chain shows they committed while it was
   still hidden.

2. ATTENTION. The gap between opening the case and committing is recorded.
   A 0.8 second approval sits in the record permanently, next to a two minute
   one. Not proof of thought - but a 400-case history of sub-second calls is
   not something anyone can explain away.

3. INDEPENDENCE. Agreement rate over time. A reviewer who has never once
   diverged from the machine is visible in the data. One who diverges
   sometimes is demonstrably exercising judgement.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
- It cannot prove the reviewer read the material. They can leave a screen open.
- Dwell time is measurable but gameable by anyone deliberately gaming it.
- It does not stop a reviewer being wrong. It records that they decided.
- If the integrating system shows its user the machine verdict before calling
  /open, this proves nothing. The ordering guarantee is only as good as the
  integration honouring it. That is a documented limit, not a hidden one.

WHAT IT IS FOR
--------------
Turning "we have human oversight" from an assertion into a dataset that an
auditor can test - and that a rubber stamper cannot hide inside.

"""
modules/publish.py  -  sealing what you published, at the moment you publish it
===============================================================================

THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS TO NEVER HAVE AGAIN
-------------------------------------------
Somebody asks when a page was published. You answer from git history. They
point out - correctly - that git commit dates are fields in the commit
object which anyone can set to anything with an environment variable before
committing. Your strongest evidence turns out to be the weakest thing in
the room, and it drags the credible parts down with it.

The fix is not a better argument. It is sealing the page the moment it goes
live, so the question never depends on anybody's word again.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
    POST /x/publish/seal {"url": "https://example.com/spec"}

We fetch the URL ourselves, hash exactly what was served, and seal the hash,
the URL and the fetch time into the chain - where it is anchored externally
and handed to peer chains like every other block.

From then on:

  - "this exact content was served at this address no later than T" is
    arithmetic rather than a claim;
  - re-sealing the same URL later builds a permanent revision history that
    the publisher cannot edit, because each version is its own block;
  - and anyone can check it without an account.

Seal at publication and you never argue about a publication date again. That
is the entire point, and it takes one call.

WHAT IT HONESTLY CANNOT DO
--------------------------
It cannot reach backwards. A seal made today proves the content existed
today, not that it existed last week. Nothing can prove that - not this, not
Bitcoin, not a notary. Timestamps are one-directional by nature.

So for anything already published before it was sealed, the module records
EXTERNAL REFERENCES alongside: a GitHub push event, a Wayback Machine
snapshot, a DigiCert or OpenTimestamps proof. Those are stored and sealed as
supplied. We do not verify them and we do not present them as ours - they
are somebody else's record, named so a third party can check it at source.
That distinction is stated in every response rather than left to be
discovered.

Two references are worth knowing about, because they are the ones that
actually carry an earlier date:

  GitHub push events   api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/events
                       The push timestamp is recorded server-side by GitHub
                       and cannot be set by the pusher, unlike commit dates.
                       Retained roughly 90 days - so it must be captured
                       while it still exists.

  Wayback Machine      archive.org/wayback/available?url=...&timestamp=...
                       An independent party with no stake in the dispute.
                       If it caught the page, that settles it outright.

FETCHING SAFELY
---------------
This module makes the server fetch a URL. Done naively that is a hole worse
than the one it closes. So the fetcher speaks only http and https, only on
ports 80 and 443, resolves the hostname first and refuses any address that
is private, loopback, link-local, reserved or multicast, never follows a
redirect, times out fast, and stops reading after a cap. Sealing is keyed,
so this is not an anonymous capability either.

    POST /x/publish/seal      fetch, hash and seal a live URL     (keyed)
    GET  /x/publish/history   every version ever sealed of a URL  (public)
    GET  /x/publish/verify    was this exact content served, when (public)
    GET  /x/publish/list      everything sealed                   (public)
    GET  /x/publish/spec      how to check any of it              (public)

modules/replay.py  -  proving the same inputs still produce the same verdict
                      WITHOUT ever disclosing how the verdict is reached
============================================================================

THE QUESTION NOBODY ELSE IN THIS MARKET CAN ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------
Every compliance platform can tell you what it decided. Not one of them can
prove it would decide the same way again.

Ask any of them to re-run decision 4,117 from its sealed inputs and show the
same verdict falls out. They cannot. Not because they will not - because
their scoring goes through a model call, and model calls are not
reproducible. Same inputs, different day, different answer. Their audit
trail describes a decision that can never be performed twice.

Ours is arithmetic. Deterministic below the model layer, and always has
been. This module lets anyone establish that for themselves.

THE SCORING LOGIC IS NEVER DISCLOSED
------------------------------------
Read this before changing anything in here.

Nothing in this module publishes, returns, echoes or hints at the contents
of the decision function. Not the source, not the weights, not the
thresholds, not the signal names, not the intermediate values. The only
thing that leaves the building is a SHA-256 of the deployed source, which
is one-way and reveals nothing about what it hashes.

Determinism is proved as a BLACK BOX instead: same inputs in, same verdict
out, demonstrated repeatedly, by the challenger, on their own schedule,
with every run sealed into the chain. That is a stronger proof than showing
the code, because it is behaviour observed over time rather than a claim
about a listing nobody can confirm is what actually runs in production.

  A competitor who reads every route here learns exactly one thing: that
  our verdicts are reproducible. Which is the point, and which they cannot
  copy, because reproducibility is a property of the architecture and not a
  feature that can be bolted on.

HOW SOMEONE CHECKS US WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING
---------------------------------------------
  POST /x/replay/challenge   send any inputs you like. We run them, seal
                             the run into the chain, and hand you back the
                             verdict, the audit hash, and a fingerprint of
                             your own inputs.

Send the same inputs again - an hour later, a year later, from a different
address. If the verdict ever moves, you have caught us, and both runs are
independently sealed and anchored so we cannot revise either one. If it
never moves, you have established determinism yourself, empirically,
adversarially, without a line of our code.

We also report how many times that exact input has been challenged, when it
was first seen, and every audit hash it produced, so the whole history is
verifiable through routes we do not control the answers to.

THE HONEST COST, WHICH IS REAL
------------------------------
An open scoring oracle can be probed. Feed it a thousand variations, watch
the verdicts move, and a determined party can map the decision boundary
without ever seeing the code. That is a genuine exposure and it is the
price of this proof.

It is mitigated, not eliminated: challenges are rate limited per address,
inputs are fingerprinted so repeat submissions are cheap and novel ones are
not, and boundary-probing patterns are already logged elsewhere in the
platform. Anyone systematically mapping the function leaves an obvious,
sealed trail while doing it.

The trade is deliberate. A closed engine nobody can test is worth less than
a testable one somebody might partially map, because the first cannot be
sold to a regulator and the second can.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
This module does not import server.py - nothing here does. It finds the
live decision function at runtime among already-loaded modules, so it can
only observe the engine, never change it. If your scorer is named something
not in SCORER_NAMES below, add it there. Everything else is read from the
audit_log schema at startup rather than assumed.

    GET  /x/replay/self          reproduction rate over a sample  (public)

```python
"""
Module router - /x/<module>/<action>

Dispatches to modules/<module>.py, which exposes:

    def handle(method, action, data, api_key, ctx): return payload, status

A module may declare PUBLIC = {("GET","attest"), ...} for routes that need no
API key. Default is closed - a route has to be opted open deliberately.

RATE LIMITING
-------------
Authenticated routes reuse the server's own check_rate (60/min, 1000/hour per
key), so module traffic counts against the same budget as /api/govern rather
than sitting outside it.

Public routes have no key to meter, so they are metered per client address on
a deliberately tighter budget. Without this, an unauthenticated endpoint is an
open invitation. The window store is bounded and self-pruning.

PAYLOAD CAP
-----------
Module bodies are capped. Nothing here needs a megabyte of JSON, and an
uncapped body on a public route is a memory exhaustion vector.

POST SUPPORT WITHOUT EDITING server.py
--------------------------------------
server.py has an /x/ branch in do_GET but not in do_POST, so POST routes
return the server's 404. The correct fix is four lines in do_POST. This is
the fix for when that is not practical.

On first import, this module patches Handler.do_POST to check for /x/ before
falling through to the original. The patch is idempotent, keeps the original
behaviour for every other path, and reverts on restart because it lives in
memory rather than on disk.

The catch, stated plainly: a module is only imported when a request reaches
the router, and the only working entry point is do_GET. So after every deploy
the first /x/ request must be a GET - after that, POST works until the next
restart. Anything hitting /x/ with a GET does it, including a browser.

This is a workaround for an editing constraint, not good architecture. If the
four lines ever go into do_POST, this patch detects the branch is already
there and does nothing.
