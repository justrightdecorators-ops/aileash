modules/verifier.py  -  hand the verifier out at a URL

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
So the proof bundles at /x/continuity/proof are useless unless somebody can
easily get hold of something that checks them, and telling people to clone a
repository is a gate.

This serves the standalone verifier as a plain file:

    curl -sO https://sebbi.pro/verify-authority.py
    curl -s "https://sebbi.pro/x/continuity/proof?evaluation=e_..." \\
        | python3 verify-authority.py -

The script it hands out has no dependencies and makes no network calls. It
checks the Ed25519 signature, recomputes every digest, re-runs the whole
derivation from the published rules, and reaches its own verdict - then says
so if that verdict disagrees with ours.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
It does not phone home, and this module records nothing about who downloaded
it. A verification tool that reports back to the party being verified is not
a verification tool.

    GET /verify-authority.py   the script
    GET /x/verifier/status     what is installed, and the script's digest

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
This script takes a bundle and reaches its own conclusion using nothing but
the Python standard library. It does not call the issuing system, it does not
import anything you have to install, and it does not take a single field of
the bundle at face value.

It does four separate things, and each one can fail on its own:

  1. SIGNATURE   Ed25519 over the canonical bundle. Confirms the bundle came
                 from the holder of the named key and has not been edited by
                 anybody since.

  2. INTEGRITY   Recomputes every grant digest, the lineage digest and the
                 parameter digest from the fields in front of it. Confirms
                 the bundle is internally consistent with its own contents.

  3. DERIVATION  Re-runs the authority rules from scratch: root issued by a
                 human, an unbroken parent chain, scope covered at every hop,
                 constraints narrowing on every axis, purpose narrowing,
                 validity windows contained, nothing revoked, and the action
                 itself inside the effective limits of the whole lineage.

  4. AGREEMENT   Compares the verdict this script reached with the verdict the
                 bundle claims. Disagreement is reported as a failure of the
                 issuer, not of this script.

WHAT A PASS MEANS
-----------------
That the authority for this action was derivable, at that time, from that
human grant - or, for a refusal, that it genuinely was not, and that the named
grant and invariant really are where it broke.

WHAT A PASS DOES NOT MEAN
-------------------------
That the root grant should ever have been issued. That the parameters describe
something that really happened. That the risk engine was right. Derivation is
not merit and it is not truth.

The risk half of a composed verdict cannot be re-derived here, because that
needs the issuer's scoring engine. Where the bundle's authority verdict is
BLOCK, the composed verdict stands regardless, because the composition takes
the worse of the two.

modules/witnessed.py  -  what an outside party had already seen, and when

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES
--------------------
Authority continuity (modules/continuity.py) derives an action back to a human
grant and re-checks every hop at execution. It is the strongest thing on this
platform and it has one gap, which is stated plainly in its own spec and is
worth restating here because it is the whole reason this module exists:

    the authorising principal, the scope and the approver all arrive on the
    request. There is no external source to ask. A well-formed grant that
    was never issued would pass every check we run.

Nothing inside a system can close that, because every term in the check is
produced by the party being checked. An auditor does not ask a company for its
cash balance. They ask the bank.

We have a bank. Since 1 August 2026 independent chains have been sealing this
chain's tip hourly into logs this operator cannot write to. That machinery was
built for a different purpose - stopping us backdating the decision record -
and it turns out to answer a question nobody pointed it at:

    a grant sealed at tree size M, and a peer that sealed our root at tree
    size N >= M at time T, means the grant existed before T, in a record
    the operator cannot reach.

That does not make a grant legitimate. It makes it impossible to invent one
afterwards - which is the attack that actually matters. When something goes
wrong, the tempting move is not to forge a signature. It is to produce a
perfectly well-formed authorisation dated last Tuesday. This is the thing that
stops that, and it needs no new protocol, no consortium and no cooperation
beyond the tip exchange already running.

WHAT IT ADDS
------------
  - an attestation record: our tree size and root, submitted to a named peer,
    with whatever that peer returned, sealed into our own chain
  - for any grant or any sealed record, the EARLIEST external attestation
    that covers it, and the exact routes a third party runs to check that
    against the peer's own host rather than ours
  - a latency figure nobody publishes: how long a grant sat unwitnessed. A
    grant witnessed nine seconds after issue is a different object from one
    witnessed nine days after, and both are stated

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
---------------------
  - it never certifies a peer's answer. Every response is recorded verbatim
    and marked unverified; the verification plan points at the peer's host
  - it never rewrites the meaning of an old attestation. A submission is
    sealed when it is made and is not amended
  - it does not claim a witnessed grant is a legitimate grant, anywhere, in
    any wording. Existence before a time is the entire claim

# ============================================================
# AI-SAFETY GRADE SCANNER - stdlib version for server.py
# (converted from the FastAPI/httpx draft - no new dependencies)
#
# HOW TO INSTALL - two pastes into server.py:
#
# PASTE 1: everything between "BEGIN FUNCTIONS" and "END FUNCTIONS"
#          goes near your other helper functions (e.g. just above
#          the JURIS_VERSION block).
#
# PASTE 2: everything between "BEGIN ROUTES" and "END ROUTES"
#          goes inside do_GET, as new elif branches alongside the
#          other GET routes (match their indentation: 8 spaces).
#
# Endpoints added:
#   GET /api/aigrade?domain=example.com        -> JSON grade report
#   GET /api/aigrade/badge?domain=example.com  -> embeddable SVG badge

"""
aileash_verify.py  -  an independent verifier for AILeash proofs
================================================================

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A single file that checks AILeash's proofs without AILeash.

No dependencies. No network calls. It never contacts sebbi.pro or anything
else - it takes proof documents you already hold and does the arithmetic
locally. Run it on a laptop with the wifi off and it works exactly the same.

That is deliberate. A proof you can only check with the prover's own online
tool is not a proof, it is a reassurance. If this file cannot confirm a
claim from the numbers alone, the claim does not hold, and the honest thing
is for you to find that out from your own machine rather than from us.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
  Inclusion    a record is inside a sealed period, against the sealed root
  Absence      a record is NOT there - the two neighbouring leaves are
               verified and shown to be adjacent, leaving nowhere for it
  Ancestry     a tip you were handed is still on the chain being served,
               at the same position, under the current root
  Prefix       the log at one size is contained in the log at a later size,
               with nothing inserted, removed or reordered in between
  Stability    across a set of replay runs, identical inputs produced
               identical verdicts under an unchanged code fingerprint

USAGE
-----
    python3 aileash_verify.py proof.json [another.json ...]
    cat proof.json | python3 aileash_verify.py
    python3 aileash_verify.py --selftest

Exit code 0 if everything checked passed, 1 if anything failed, 2 on bad
input. Suitable for dropping into an audit script or a CI job.

Each proof document is whatever the relevant AILeash route returned. Save
the JSON, keep it, and check it whenever you like - next week, or in four
years when the original system is long gone.

HOW TO GET PROOFS
-----------------
    /x/complete/prove?period=&value=       inclusion or absence
    /x/consistency/ancestor?tip=           ancestry
    /x/consistency/proof?first=&second=    prefix
    /x/replay/history?input_hash=          stability

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK
----------------------
  - That a sealed record is TRUE. Cryptography proves a record existed at a
    time and has not moved since. It says nothing about whether the record
    was honest when it was written. Nothing can.
  - That a root was anchored. That is a separate check against the
    OpenTimestamps proof and a Bitcoin node - out of scope for a file with
    no dependencies, and it should be done independently anyway.
  - Whether a decision was correct or fair. Determinism is not fairness.

The two hash schemes below are different on purpose and must not be mixed.
The completeness tree is SORTED, which is what makes absence provable. The
consistency tree is in WRITE ORDER, which is what makes reordering
detectable. Their roots will never match and are not meant to.

Public domain / MIT - copy it, fork it, audit it, ship it inside your own
tooling. The more independent copies of this exist, the less any of it
depends on us.

```python
"""
anchor.py  -  External anchoring for the AILeash chain.

WHAT IT DOES (plain words):
  Every ANCHOR_INTERVAL seconds it takes the current chain tip (one hash) and
  timestamps it against an external source you do NOT control - so anyone can
  prove your chain's timestamps are real without trusting sebbi.pro.

  It tries OpenTimestamps first (commits the hash into Bitcoin, free, gold
  standard). It ALSO records the tip + time to a local append-only anchor log
  on your persistent volume as a second record. If OTS is unavailable for any
  reason, the server keeps running normally - anchoring never blocks or
  crashes your live engine.

SAFETY:
  - Only READS the chain tip. Never writes to the chain, never touches scoring.
  - Runs on a background daemon thread.
  - Every failure is caught and logged; your govern path is never affected.

SETUP ON RAILWAY:
  - requirements.txt:  opentimestamps-client
  - Variable ANCHOR_DIR = /data/anchors   (on your persistent volume)
  - Variable ANCHOR_INTERVAL = 3600       (once an hour; optional)
  - Variable ANCHOR_ENABLED = 1           (set 0 to switch off)
