modules/rulebind.py  -  rule binding, provable without an account

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
-------------------------
Eighteen months after a decision, nobody asks what was decided. They ask which
rules were live at that instant. Most systems answer with a changelog somebody
could have edited, or with a version number sitting beside the record rather
than inside it - which proves nothing, because anything beside a record can be
changed afterwards to suit.

The claim worth making is narrower and harder: the ruleset version was
committed at the moment of the decision, in the same sealed object, and a
verdict cannot later be reattributed to different rules.

HOW IT IS PROVED WITHOUT TRUSTING US
------------------------------------
Every decision here produces a binding digest:

    AILEASH-RULEBIND-v1|<pack_id>|<pack_hash>|<inputs_digest>|<verdict>|<score>|<sealed_at>

SHA-256 of that string is what gets sealed into the chain. Every component is
published. So anyone can take the components we return, rebuild the string
themselves, hash it, and check it equals the binding in the sealed record.

That is the whole proof, and it works in both directions:

  - change the pack hash after the fact and the binding no longer recomputes
  - change the binding and the chain breaks from that block onwards
  - change the chain and it stops matching the external anchor and the peer
    chain that recorded our tip an hour later

None of those require taking our word for anything, and none require us to
disclose the scoring logic - the inputs are published as a digest, not as
values, and the weights are never exposed at any point.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
----------------------
That the rules were good ones. That the verdict was correct. That the pack
does what its description says. It proves which ruleset produced which verdict
and that the pairing was fixed at the time rather than asserted later. Narrow,
and the only part that is actually provable.

ROUTES  (all public - the point is that no account is needed)
------------------------------------------------------------
  POST /x/rulebind/prove       run a decision, get every component back
  GET  /x/rulebind/verify?receipt=   recompute the binding for a sealed record
  GET  /x/rulebind/packs       ruleset versions and when each was first sealed
  GET  /x/rulebind/spec        what this proves and what it does not

```python
"""
modules/savings.py  -  the cost model at /savings

WHAT IT IS
----------
One page. Enter a device count, see what a traditional compliance architecture
costs against a proof-based one, and change every assumption behind it.

WHY THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE EDITABLE
--------------------------------
The saving rests on one number - what the traditional architecture costs per
device per year - and that number is ours, not theirs. Asserted, it is the
first thing a finance director dismisses. Broken into ingestion, storage,
monitoring, pipeline and engineering, with every line editable, the arithmetic
runs on their figures instead of ours. Harder to wave away, and honest.

The page will also say plainly when the saving goes negative on the numbers
somebody has typed. A calculator that can only ever produce a good answer is
not a calculator.

NO TRACKING, NO STORAGE
-----------------------
Everything happens in the browser. Nothing is submitted, nothing is recorded,
no figure anyone types reaches the server. A buyer modelling their own costs
should not have to wonder where those went.

SAME PATCH AS network.py AND console.py
---------------------------------------
The router hands whatever handle() returns to send_json, so a module cannot
return HTML through it. This patches do_GET at runtime, adds one path, leaves
every other path alone. After each deploy one /x/ request must arrive before
/savings exists - opening /x/savings/status does it.

    <p><b>Most of that cost is moving and keeping data.</b> Sensitive records get shipped somewhere central, held for years, indexed so they can be searched, and watched so nothing goes missing — because the plan is to reconstruct what happened by reading it all back later.</p>
    <p><b>A proof-based layer answers the question at the moment the decision is made.</b> The decision is scored, sealed into a hash chain, externally timestamped and recorded by an independent platform. What survives is a proof that the decision happened, under stated rules, and has not been altered since.</p>
    <p><b>So the volume stops being the problem.</b> A seal is the same size whether the record behind it is a line or a megabyte, and it does not have to leave your systems for the proof to hold. You keep your own data where it already is.</p>
    <p>It does not replace your logs, and it is not meant to. It replaces the machinery built to make logs trustworthy — which is the part that scales badly.</p>

modules/selfcheck.py  -  the conformance runner, served as a page

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A FILE IN ROOT
-------------------------------------------
A plain .html in the repo root does not get served on this deployment, so
the page ships inside the module and is served by the same runtime do_GET
patch that console.py uses for /console and network.py uses for /witness.
It also means the page cannot drift from the module that serves it.

WHAT THE PAGE DOES
------------------
Reads /.well-known/ordering-test.json, then runs every check the document
declares, in the order the document declares them. It discovers what it
needs as it goes: a committed period from /x/complete/periods, a tree size
from /x/consistency/root, a probe value that is not in the log.

It reports four outcomes and is deliberately mean about which is which:

  VERIFIED       the response was checked for what the claim requires -
                 consecutive leaf indices for absence, a proof path for
                 consistency, identical verdicts for reproducibility
  INCONCLUSIVE   the endpoint answered but the semantics were not checked,
                 or the route is POST-only, or the check is key-gated
  FAILED         published as publicly demonstrable and the endpoint is
                 not there. This is the number that matters
  NOT SUPPORTED  the document does not claim it

Reachable is not the same as verified, and this page never counts one as
the other. A runner that only ever passes has not been tested.

NOT A SHARED RUNNER
-------------------
It tests one side. The discovery document's runner field stays null until
the checks are jointly agreed with the other mirror, and publishing this as
though it were the agreed conformance test would claim something neither
operator has earned. Served unlinked and noindex for that reason.
