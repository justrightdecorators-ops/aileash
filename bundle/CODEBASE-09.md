ratchet.py - time only runs one way for the machine.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
heartbeat.py proves WHEN a record can have been made. sortition.py proves
NOBODY CHOSE what got reviewed. This one proves an actor cannot move
backwards through time.

Every action an agent takes is bound to the beacon round current at the
moment it acted. Beacon rounds only ever increase. So an actor's actions
form a strictly rising ladder, and the rule is one line:

    an action carrying a beacon round at or below the actor's last
    recorded round is REFUSED.

WHAT THAT KILLS, WITHOUT A POLICY, A PROMPT OR A PROMISE
--------------------------------------------------------
BACKDATING     An agent cannot produce an action claiming to sit earlier
               than one it already took. The earlier round is already
               spent.
REPLAY         Capture a valid action and fire it again later: the round
               is stale and the digest is already on the ladder.
PRE-COMPUTATION
               An agent cannot prepare a batch of actions in advance,
               because it cannot know tomorrow's beacon values today. A
               round that has not been sealed here yet is refused.
REWIND         Restore an agent from an old snapshot to undo its history
               and its next action lands below the recorded floor. The
               ladder is in a chain the agent does not control, so
               restoring the agent does not restore its position.

REFUSALS ARE SEALED, NOT DROPPED
--------------------------------
This is the part that matters. A refused action is written into the chain
with the reason. An agent trying to rewind is the single most interesting
event this system can observe, and throwing it away as a 409 would be
throwing away the evidence. /x/ratchet/refusals is public.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
- It binds an actor's actions to an order. It says nothing about whether
  any action was correct, authorised, or wise.
- An actor that simply stops acting cannot be forced to continue. Silence
  is visible (last_seen goes stale) but is not prevented.
- Two different actor ids are two different ladders. Anyone able to mint
  new actor ids can start a fresh ladder; that is an identity problem,
  handled by whatever issues the ids, not here.
- The floor is only as fine-grained as the beat cadence. At a five
  minute cadence, two actions inside the same beat are ordered by
  sequence, not by beacon time, and that is reported rather than dressed
  up.
- It depends on heartbeat. With no beats sealed, nothing can be admitted,
  and this module says so rather than waving actions through.

Contract: handle(method, action, data, api_key, ctx) -> (dict, status)
Routes:
  GET  spec      public  what this is and the exact admission rules
  GET  actor     public  ?id= - one actor's current rung and ladder
  GET  actors    public  every ladder, with staleness
  GET  refusals  public  every refused attempt, with reason. The good bit.
  GET  verify    public  ?id= - re-walk a ladder and report any break
  GET  status    public  coverage, admission and refusal counts
  POST act       keyed   submit an action. Admitted or refused; both sealed.

Reconciliation notary - /x/reconcile/<action>

THE PROBLEM THIS ATTACKS
------------------------
A sealed chain proves records were not altered after the fact. It does not
prove they were true when written. An operator who seals fiction on time has
a tamper-evident chain of fiction. Every honest person in this market knows
that, and almost nobody says it.

You cannot prove truth from outside a system. What you CAN do is what real
auditors do: substantive testing. Take the sealed claim, go to the operator's
own live system, and check whether the two agree - then seal the result of
that check, including the failures.

WHY THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT
-------------------------
The sample is fixed before the operator sees it.

/plan derives a selection seed from the current chain tip - a value the
operator cannot predict in advance and cannot change afterwards without
breaking the chain - picks the records to be tested, and seals that selection
BEFORE any data is requested. Only then are the record identifiers returned.

So the operator cannot choose which records get examined, cannot prepare only
the flattering ones, and cannot quietly drop a test that came back badly:
every planned run is sealed at the moment it is planned, and a plan with no
submitted result is visible forever as an abandoned test.

Mismatches are sealed with the same permanence as matches. That is the whole
design. A reconciliation system that can bury its own failures is decoration.

WHAT A PASS ACTUALLY MEANS
--------------------------
That two systems the operator controls agree with each other, on records the
operator could not choose, at a time the operator could not pick.

That is not proof of truth. An operator who fabricates consistently across
every system, in real time, without knowing what will be sampled, will pass.
What it does is raise the cost of lying from "edit one database" to
"maintain a coherent parallel reality across independent systems indefinitely,
under unpredictable sampling, with every failure sealed permanently."

That is the honest claim. It is also, as far as I know, more than anyone else
in this market is doing.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
- Consistency is not truth. Two agreeing systems can both be wrong.
- The operator supplies the comparison data. This tests their systems against
  each other, not against the world.
- Sampling only covers what has been sealed. It cannot find a decision that
  was never recorded at all - gapless receipts are what cover that.
- A high match rate on a badly chosen field proves nothing. Reconcile the
  fields that would hurt to get wrong.

modules/replay.py  -  proving the same inputs still produce the same verdict
                      WITHOUT ever disclosing how the verdict is reached
============================================================================

THE QUESTION NOBODY ELSE IN THIS MARKET CAN ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------
Every compliance platform can tell you what it decided. Not one of them can
prove it would decide the same way again.

Ask any of them to re-run decision 4,117 from its sealed inputs and show the
same verdict falls out. They cannot. Not because they will not - because
their scoring goes through a model call, and model calls are not
reproducible. Same inputs, different day, different answer. Their audit
trail describes a decision that can never be performed twice.

Ours is arithmetic. Deterministic below the model layer, and always has
been. This module lets anyone establish that for themselves.

THE SCORING LOGIC IS NEVER DISCLOSED
------------------------------------
Read this before changing anything in here.

Nothing in this module publishes, returns, echoes or hints at the contents
of the decision function. Not the source, not the weights, not the
thresholds, not the signal names, not the intermediate values. The only
thing that leaves the building is a SHA-256 of the deployed source, which
is one-way and reveals nothing about what it hashes.

Determinism is proved as a BLACK BOX instead: same inputs in, same verdict
out, demonstrated repeatedly, by the challenger, on their own schedule,
with every run sealed into the chain. That is a stronger proof than showing
the code, because it is behaviour observed over time rather than a claim
about a listing nobody can confirm is what actually runs in production.

  A competitor who reads every route here learns exactly one thing: that
  our verdicts are reproducible. Which is the point, and which they cannot
  copy, because reproducibility is a property of the architecture and not a
  feature that can be bolted on.

HOW SOMEONE CHECKS US WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING
---------------------------------------------
  POST /x/replay/challenge   send any inputs you like. We run them, seal
                             the run into the chain, and hand you back the
                             verdict, the audit hash, and a fingerprint of
                             your own inputs.

Send the same inputs again - an hour later, a year later, from a different
address. If the verdict ever moves, you have caught us, and both runs are
independently sealed and anchored so we cannot revise either one. If it
never moves, you have established determinism yourself, empirically,
adversarially, without a line of our code.

We also report how many times that exact input has been challenged, when it
was first seen, and every audit hash it produced, so the whole history is
verifiable through routes we do not control the answers to.

THE HONEST COST, WHICH IS REAL
------------------------------
An open scoring oracle can be probed. Feed it a thousand variations, watch
the verdicts move, and a determined party can map the decision boundary
without ever seeing the code. That is a genuine exposure and it is the
price of this proof.

It is mitigated, not eliminated: challenges are rate limited per address,
inputs are fingerprinted so repeat submissions are cheap and novel ones are
not, and boundary-probing patterns are already logged elsewhere in the
platform. Anyone systematically mapping the function leaves an obvious,
sealed trail while doing it.

The trade is deliberate. A closed engine nobody can test is worth less than
a testable one somebody might partially map, because the first cannot be
sold to a regulator and the second can.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
This module does not import server.py - nothing here does. It finds the
live decision function at runtime among already-loaded modules, so it can
only observe the engine, never change it. If your scorer is named something
not in SCORER_NAMES below, add it there. Everything else is read from the
audit_log schema at startup rather than assumed.

```python
"""
modules/roster.py  v1.2  -  the canonical network list

WHY
    Witnessing runs on each operator's own machine. A new chain can join
    the network and nobody else's server knows it exists, because nobody
    told it. The result is a star with one operator in the middle, which
    is the shape a witnessed log is supposed to avoid.

    This publishes the list. Every peer, every tip URL, one public route.
    A peer's sync reads it and witnesses everyone on it, including
    whoever joined this morning.

    It does not witness anything itself. It is a phone book.

WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM
    witness_log and witness_names, which witness.py already maintains,
    plus signed_keys from signed.py where it exists. Nothing new is
    recorded and no existing module changes. A chain appears here because
    it submitted a tip, which is the same thing that binds its name today.

WHAT MAKES THE LIST HONEST
    Every entry carries its own evidence: when it was first and last
    seen, how many observations, whether its name is bound to a host or
    to a key, and whether it has gone quiet. Nothing is filtered out for
    looking bad. A silent chain stays listed and is marked silent,
    because hiding it would make the list a claim rather than a record.

WHAT CHANGED IN 1.2, AND WHY
    Two things, both prompted by peers reading their own entries.

    1. THE STATUS WORDS NOW MEAN WHAT THE OTHER ROUTE MEANS.
       /x/witness/peers has always used three bands - current under 6h,
       stale from 6 to 48, silent beyond. This route used two, so the
       same peer could read "silent" here and "stale" there in the same
       minute, with no way to tell which was the real one. They now match,
       and both publish what the bands mean.

       The words describe elapsed time since we last recorded an
       observation. Nothing else. A peer who publishes on a human
       schedule rather than a timer reads stale between sessions, and
       that is correct rather than a fault. It is never a claim that
       anyone's endpoint was unavailable, and Philip Pinol (PRAXIS) had
       to point that out from his own seat, which he should not have had
       to do.

    2. THE LIST NOW EXPLAINS ITS OWN VOCABULARY.
       Entries carry liveness and name_status values written by
       witness.py, and signed.py adds two more of them. Publishing a word
       a reader cannot look up is the same failure as "confirmed" was:
       the meaning lives somewhere else and does not travel with the
       record. Every value this route can emit is now defined in the
       response that emits it.

ROUTES

Module router - /x/<module>/<action>

Dispatches to modules/<module>.py, which exposes:

    def handle(method, action, data, api_key, ctx): return payload, status

A module may declare PUBLIC = {("GET","attest"), ...} for routes that need no
API key. Default is closed - a route has to be opted open deliberately.

RATE LIMITING
-------------
Authenticated routes reuse the server's own check_rate (60/min, 1000/hour per
key), so module traffic counts against the same budget as /api/govern rather
than sitting outside it.

Public routes have no key to meter, so they are metered per client address on
a deliberately tighter budget. Without this, an unauthenticated endpoint is an
open invitation. The window store is bounded and self-pruning.

PAYLOAD CAP
-----------
Module bodies are capped. Nothing here needs a megabyte of JSON, and an
uncapped body on a public route is a memory exhaustion vector.

POST SUPPORT WITHOUT EDITING server.py
--------------------------------------
server.py has an /x/ branch in do_GET but not in do_POST, so POST routes
return the server's 404. The correct fix is four lines in do_POST. This is
the fix for when that is not practical.

On first import, this module patches Handler.do_POST to check for /x/ before
falling through to the original. The patch is idempotent, keeps the original
behaviour for every other path, and reverts on restart because it lives in
memory rather than on disk.

The catch, stated plainly: a module is only imported when a request reaches
the router, and the only working entry point is do_GET. So after every deploy
the first /x/ request must be a GET - after that, POST works until the next
restart. Anything hitting /x/ with a GET does it, including a browser.

This is a workaround for an editing constraint, not good architecture. If the
four lines ever go into do_POST, this patch detects the branch is already
there and does nothing.
