Peer-signed submissions - /x/signed/<action>

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
-------------------
Two people arrived at the same missing piece from opposite directions on the
same day.

Ishaan (Shango MID) read the existing signed lane and said, correctly, that
"binds a name to a secret rather than to an address" reads stronger than it
is. An HMAC uses a shared secret. A shared secret is held by both parties. So
it proves the submission came from SOMEONE HOLDING THE SECRET - which is the
peer and also the operator of this deployment. It closes third-party
submission under a peer's name. It does not close operator submission under a
peer's name.

Chidi (ViriSIM) came at it from the regulator's side: for the evidence to mean
anything to a third party, the customer has to sign, not the platform holding
the customer's records.

Same gap. This module closes it.

HOW
---
The peer generates an Ed25519 keypair and keeps the private half. This
deployment is given ONLY the public half. A public key is not a secret and
grants nothing: it verifies a signature and cannot produce one.

From then on, a submission under that name is accepted only if it carries a
signature this deployment can verify against that public key - and this
deployment CANNOT create such a signature, because it does not hold the
private key and never has. The property is not a promise about our conduct.
It is arithmetic.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE RECORD
------------------------------
The other lanes answer "did somebody hand us this tip". This lane answers
"did the holder of this key hand us this tip", and the difference matters
precisely when the operator is the party you are worried about.

A regulator or auditor reading a signed observation does not have to trust
this deployment about who submitted it. They can take the public key from
/x/signed/keys, take the canonical message and the signature from the record,
and check it themselves with any Ed25519 library in any language.

WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO
-------------------------
- It does not prove the records behind the tip are true. Nothing here does.
- It does not prove completeness. A signed chain can still omit records.
  Catching that needs an audit protocol, not cryptography - see Chidi's
  incognito-user test, which is the only thing anyone has proposed that
  attacks it.
- It does not prove who the keyholder IS. It proves the same party signed
  each time. Identity is a separate problem and this does not solve it.
- Enrolment is open, so the first party to enrol a name gets it. Same as
  everywhere else in this standard, that is detection rather than
  prevention: an enrolment is sealed, permanent and public, and an enrolment
  placed over a name already seen in the witness log is flagged as such.

WHY THE OPERATOR CANNOT QUIETLY SWAP A KEY
------------------------------------------
The obvious attack on the whole idea: the operator replaces the peer's public
key with one of their own, then signs freely. So there is no route that
overwrites a key. Rotation exists, and a rotation must itself be signed by
the key being replaced. An operator who does not hold the current private key
cannot rotate it, and every rotation is sealed into the chain with both keys
recorded. A peer who has lost their key cannot rotate either - they enrol a
new name, and the abandoned one stays visible.

CANONICAL MESSAGE
-----------------
Exactly this, UTF-8, no trailing newline, four lines joined by \\n:

    aileash-signed-v1
    <chain>
    <tip>
    <ts>

  chain  the peer name, lowercase, as enrolled
  tip    64 lowercase hex characters
  ts     integer epoch seconds, no decimal point

Sign those bytes with the Ed25519 private key. Send the 64-byte signature as
128 lowercase hex characters. The message is deliberately short, positional
and free of JSON so that two implementations cannot disagree about how to
build it.

Rotation signs a different message with the SAME shape:

    aileash-rotate-v1
    <chain>
    <new public key, 64 hex>
    <ts>

REPLAY
------
A signature is a bearer token for the statement it signs. Anyone who sees one
can send it again. So: ts must be within SKEW_PAST seconds behind and
SKEW_FUTURE ahead of our clock, ts must be strictly greater than the last ts
we accepted for that name, and an exact repeat of a signature already stored
is refused. None of that is exotic - it is the ordinary set, written down so
nobody has to guess which of them we do.

WHY THIS LANE REJECTS, WHEN THE OPEN LANE NEVER DOES
----------------------------------------------------
/x/witness/observe sea1s everything and describes what it sealed, because
refusing an anonymous submission would mean deciding who is allowed to be
recorded. This lane is the opposite case. A submission whose signature does
not verify has no business being written into a name's history at all - the
harm is exactly that it would sit in the record looking like an event
involving that peer. So this lane refuses, says why, and seals nothing.

"""
Live API specification - /x/spec

/api/spec is a hardcoded constant. It describes the API as it was when
somebody last remembered to update it, which is a documentation problem
pretending to be a feature.

This discovers what is actually loaded, right now, by reading the modules
directory and each module's own docstring. Add a module and the spec
updates itself. Delete one and it disappears. There is no separate list to
maintain and therefore no list that can drift.

That matters here more than it would elsewhere: a platform whose pitch is
"check it, don't trust it" should not ship a self-description that is
quietly out of date.

"""
modules/standard.py  -  the Ordering Test discovery document for this domain

WHAT IT SERVES
--------------
  GET /.well-known/ordering-test.json   this operator's discovery document
  GET /x/standard/hash                  sha256 of that document
  GET /x/standard/status                what is installed, and honest counts

SHAPE
-----
Deliberately identical to the shape Red Flag AI Pro published first:

    checks: { <name>: { supported, demonstrable_publicly, endpoint, note } }

Two fields, not one, and the second is the better idea. "We built it" and
"you can verify it without an account" are different claims, and most of this
market blurs them. Separating them lets a vendor be honest about having
something real that an outsider still has to take on trust.

WHAT THE HOST HEADER IS DOING HERE
----------------------------------
base_url is derived from the request rather than written into the file. An
earlier draft had the domain hardcoded, which meant any operator running it
would publish somebody else's domain as the source - the opposite of a mirror.
Deriving it means this file can be lifted to any domain and tells the truth
about wherever it is actually running.

EVERY PUBLISHED ENDPOINT MUST WORK AS WRITTEN
---------------------------------------------
An endpoint marked demonstrable_publicly is a promise that a stranger can copy
it out of this document and get an answer. If the route needs a parameter, the
document names that parameter. If a value has to be discovered first, the
document says where to discover it. An endpoint that errors when followed
literally is a failed check, not a documentation detail.

HONESTY RULES THIS FILE FOLLOWS
-------------------------------
  - A check we have not built says supported: false. It does not quietly go
    missing from the document.
  - A check that exists but needs an account says demonstrable_publicly:
    false, however much we would like the tick.
  - runner is null. A runner exists in draft, but the checks have not been
    jointly agreed with the other mirror, so publishing one as though it were
    a settled standard would claim something neither operator has earned yet.

None of that is modesty. A conformance document whose author scores full marks
on the day they publish it is a marketing page.

Live figures for the Proving Ground - /x/stats

Charts on a compliance site are usually decoration. These are not, provided
they show something a visitor could otherwise only take on trust: that the
chain is genuinely growing, that decisions really are distributed across the
thresholds rather than hand-picked, and that people who click through a
review case behave exactly as the oversight argument predicts.

WHAT IS PUBLISHED, AND WHAT IS NOT
----------------------------------
Public and no key, because a figure nobody can see proves nothing.

Published: total chain height, hourly block counts, the verdict mix and score
distribution of PUBLIC DEMO decisions only, and dwell times from public review
cases.

Never published: anything scoped to a customer key. No customer verdict mix,
no customer volumes, no per-key anything. A visitor learns how the engine
behaves, not how any operator's business is going. That distinction is the
whole reason this endpoint can be open.

modules/verifier.py  -  hand the verifier out at a URL

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
So the proof bundles at /x/continuity/proof are useless unless somebody can
easily get hold of something that checks them, and telling people to clone a
repository is a gate.

This serves the standalone verifier as a plain file:

    curl -sO https://sebbi.pro/verify-authority.py
    curl -s "https://sebbi.pro/x/continuity/proof?evaluation=e_..." \\
        | python3 verify-authority.py -

The script it hands out has no dependencies and makes no network calls. It
checks the Ed25519 signature, recomputes every digest, re-runs the whole
derivation from the published rules, and reaches its own verdict - then says
so if that verdict disagrees with ours.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
It does not phone home, and this module records nothing about who downloaded
it. A verification tool that reports back to the party being verified is not
a verification tool.

    GET /verify-authority.py   the script
    GET /x/verifier/status     what is installed, and the script's digest

        | python3 verify_authority.py -

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
A proof that can only be checked by the party who issued it is not a proof.
This script takes a bundle and reaches its own conclusion using nothing but
the Python standard library. It does not call the issuing system, it does not
import anything you have to install, and it does not take a single field of
the bundle at face value.

It does four separate things, and each one can fail on its own:

  1. SIGNATURE   Ed25519 over the canonical bundle. Confirms the bundle came
                 from the holder of the named key and has not been edited by
                 anybody since.

  2. INTEGRITY   Recomputes every grant digest, the lineage digest and the
                 parameter digest from the fields in front of it. Confirms
                 the bundle is internally consistent with its own contents.

  3. DERIVATION  Re-runs the authority rules from scratch: root issued by a
                 human, an unbroken parent chain, scope covered at every hop,
                 constraints narrowing on every axis, purpose narrowing,
                 validity windows contained, nothing revoked, and the action
                 itself inside the effective limits of the whole lineage.

  4. AGREEMENT   Compares the verdict this script reached with the verdict the
                 bundle claims. Disagreement is reported as a failure of the
                 issuer, not of this script.

WHAT A PASS MEANS
-----------------
That the authority for this action was derivable, at that time, from that
human grant - or, for a refusal, that it genuinely was not, and that the named
grant and invariant really are where it broke.

WHAT A PASS DOES NOT MEAN
-------------------------
That the root grant should ever have been issued. That the parameters describe
something that really happened. That the risk engine was right. Derivation is
not merit and it is not truth.

The risk half of a composed verdict cannot be re-derived here, because that
needs the issuer's scoring engine. Where the bundle's authority verdict is
BLOCK, the composed verdict stands regardless, because the composition takes
the worse of the two.

```python
"""
modules/warmup.py  v1.0  -  arm every page module in one request

THE PROBLEM THIS ENDS
---------------------
console.py, packconsole.py, peerconsole.py, selfcheck.py and the rest all
install their page by patching do_GET at runtime, and that only happens the
first time their handle() runs. So after every deploy the pages 404 until
somebody happens to hit each module's /x/ route.

Worse, most of those modules only make `status` public. A keyless request to
/x/console/ is rejected by the router before the module is ever imported, so
the obvious way of arming them does not work and looks like a broken site
instead of a cold one.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
One public route that imports each page module and calls its handle() once,
which is exactly what installs the patch. Every page comes back in a single
request, with no key.

    GET /x/warmup/all       arm everything, report what happened
    GET /x/warmup/status    what is armed right now, arms nothing
    GET /x/warmup/spec      what this is

POINT RAILWAY AT IT
-------------------
Set the healthcheck path to:

    /x/warmup/all

Railway calls it after every deploy, so the site is armed before anyone
opens it. It always returns 200 as long as the process is up - a module
that fails to arm is reported in the body rather than failing the
healthcheck, because one broken page should not roll back a good deploy.

SAFE TO RUN REPEATEDLY
----------------------
Every module guards its own patch with a `_patched` flag, so a second call
is a no-op. Call it every minute if you like.

ADDING A MODULE
---------------
Put its name in PAGE_MODULES. Nothing else. If the module is not deployed
it is reported as missing and the others still arm.
