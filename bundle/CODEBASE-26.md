ratchet.py - time only runs one way for the machine.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
heartbeat.py proves WHEN a record can have been made. sortition.py proves
NOBODY CHOSE what got reviewed. This one proves an actor cannot move
backwards through time.

Every action an agent takes is bound to the beacon round current at the
moment it acted. Beacon rounds only ever increase. So an actor's actions
form a strictly rising ladder, and the rule is one line:

    an action carrying a beacon round at or below the actor's last
    recorded round is REFUSED.

WHAT THAT KILLS, WITHOUT A POLICY, A PROMPT OR A PROMISE
--------------------------------------------------------
BACKDATING     An agent cannot produce an action claiming to sit earlier
               than one it already took. The earlier round is already
               spent.
REPLAY         Capture a valid action and fire it again later: the round
               is stale and the digest is already on the ladder.
PRE-COMPUTATION
               An agent cannot prepare a batch of actions in advance,
               because it cannot know tomorrow's beacon values today. A
               round that has not been sealed here yet is refused.
REWIND         Restore an agent from an old snapshot to undo its history
               and its next action lands below the recorded floor. The
               ladder is in a chain the agent does not control, so
               restoring the agent does not restore its position.

REFUSALS ARE SEALED, NOT DROPPED
--------------------------------
This is the part that matters. A refused action is written into the chain
with the reason. An agent trying to rewind is the single most interesting
event this system can observe, and throwing it away as a 409 would be
throwing away the evidence. /x/ratchet/refusals is public.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
- It binds an actor's actions to an order. It says nothing about whether
  any action was correct, authorised, or wise.
- An actor that simply stops acting cannot be forced to continue. Silence
  is visible (last_seen goes stale) but is not prevented.
- Two different actor ids are two different ladders. Anyone able to mint
  new actor ids can start a fresh ladder; that is an identity problem,
  handled by whatever issues the ids, not here.
- The floor is only as fine-grained as the beat cadence. At a five
  minute cadence, two actions inside the same beat are ordered by
  sequence, not by beacon time, and that is reported rather than dressed
  up.
- It depends on heartbeat. With no beats sealed, nothing can be admitted,
  and this module says so rather than waving actions through.

Contract: handle(method, action, data, api_key, ctx) -> (dict, status)
Routes:
  GET  spec      public  what this is and the exact admission rules
  GET  actor     public  ?id= - one actor's current rung and ladder
  GET  actors    public  every ladder, with staleness
  GET  refusals  public  every refused attempt, with reason. The good bit.
  GET  verify    public  ?id= - re-walk a ladder and report any break
  GET  status    public  coverage, admission and refusal counts
  POST act       keyed   submit an action. Admitted or refused; both sealed.

Reconciliation notary - /x/reconcile/<action>

THE PROBLEM THIS ATTACKS
------------------------
A sealed chain proves records were not altered after the fact. It does not
prove they were true when written. An operator who seals fiction on time has
a tamper-evident chain of fiction. Every honest person in this market knows
that, and almost nobody says it.

You cannot prove truth from outside a system. What you CAN do is what real
auditors do: substantive testing. Take the sealed claim, go to the operator's
own live system, and check whether the two agree - then seal the result of
that check, including the failures.

WHY THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT
-------------------------
The sample is fixed before the operator sees it.

/plan derives a selection seed from the current chain tip - a value the
operator cannot predict in advance and cannot change afterwards without
breaking the chain - picks the records to be tested, and seals that selection
BEFORE any data is requested. Only then are the record identifiers returned.

So the operator cannot choose which records get examined, cannot prepare only
the flattering ones, and cannot quietly drop a test that came back badly:
every planned run is sealed at the moment it is planned, and a plan with no
submitted result is visible forever as an abandoned test.

Mismatches are sealed with the same permanence as matches. That is the whole
design. A reconciliation system that can bury its own failures is decoration.

WHAT A PASS ACTUALLY MEANS
--------------------------
That two systems the operator controls agree with each other, on records the
operator could not choose, at a time the operator could not pick.

That is not proof of truth. An operator who fabricates consistently across
every system, in real time, without knowing what will be sampled, will pass.
What it does is raise the cost of lying from "edit one database" to
"maintain a coherent parallel reality across independent systems indefinitely,
under unpredictable sampling, with every failure sealed permanently."

That is the honest claim. It is also, as far as I know, more than anyone else
in this market is doing.

HONEST LIMITS
-------------
- Consistency is not truth. Two agreeing systems can both be wrong.
- The operator supplies the comparison data. This tests their systems against
  each other, not against the world.
- Sampling only covers what has been sealed. It cannot find a decision that
  was never recorded at all - gapless receipts are what cover that.
- A high match rate on a badly chosen field proves nothing. Reconcile the
  fields that would hurt to get wrong.
