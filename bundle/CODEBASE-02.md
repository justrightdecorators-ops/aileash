modules/bind.py  -  the signed lane

WHAT CHANGED IN 1.1
-------------------
receipt_seq is a real number here now, and it means something.

Until this version this lane returned whatever server.py's seal() gave
back for the sequence, and passed None as the api_key when calling it.
seal() only issues its counter when a key is supplied, because that
counter lives on the api_keys row - so the value was always null. The
field was in the response, named as though it were a receipt sequence,
carrying nothing.

That is not a cosmetic problem. The point of a sequence number is that a
holder of receipts N and N+2 can PROVE N+1 exists and was not received.
A null cannot do that, so this lane had no completeness property at all
while appearing to offer one.

Found on the sibling lane at /x/peer/submit by Philip Pinol (PRAXIS),
whose schema required an integer and got a null. Same fault, same fix,
applied here before anybody hit it: the sequence is issued by this module,
per name, from its own counter, incremented and read inside the SAME lock
hold that writes the submission row. A number is never spent on a
submission that was not stored, and never skipped for one that was.

The server-wide counter is still returned, as key_seq, and is still null.
It is reported rather than omitted so the absence is visible instead of
inferred - which is exactly the confusion that made this worth fixing.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Name binding used to depend on a fetcher reaching a URL and parsing JSON
out of it. Three things were wrong with that and a reviewer found all
three:

  - a page that is reachable but serves HTML does not bind, and the
    platform described it as if it did
  - a name with no binding is claimable by anybody, so a peer who followed
    that description was left one submission away from being squatted
  - the failure text asserted the URL was unreachable, when all the check
    had established was that the response was not JSON. Reachability and
    parseability are two different facts and conflating them put a false
    statement in a sealed block

This module removes the fetcher from the trust path entirely.

A peer signs their own submission with a credential. Binding then rests on
possession of a secret rather than on my crawler reaching anything, parsing
anything, or on my description of what happens when it cannot. Nobody has to
stand up an endpoint whose only purpose is to satisfy someone else's fetcher.

WHAT A SIGNED BINDING PROVES, EXACTLY
-------------------------------------
That whoever submitted holds the credential issued for that name, on the date
it was issued, and that the submission has not been altered since signing.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
----------------------
That they own the domain. That they are who the name suggests. That anything
in their chain is true. A credential is a shared secret between two parties
and nothing more - it makes a name unstealable, not a claim honest. Domain
control is a separate check this module does not perform and does not imply.

    POST /x/bind/claim      seal a dated claim marker       (operator key)

modules/binddesk.py  -  buttons for the signed lane

modules/bind.py is the engine. It answers POST requests with a key, which is
correct and completely unusable from a phone: a browser address bar can only
send GET, and nothing in it can attach an Authorization header.

So this is the page. Paste the key once, tap a button. Same routes underneath,
nothing new in the trust path.

Served at /bind-desk by the same runtime do_GET patch console.py uses. The
page holds nothing - the key is typed in, kept in the tab, and sent on each
request. Every route it calls checks that key itself.

PUBLIC is empty. Nothing here is reachable without a key except the page
itself, and the page is inert until one is pasted into it.
"""

# patch that only runs once this module is touched, and every other route here

# browser cannot send an Authorization header. The status route reveals only
# that the desk exists and where the page is.

One-button decision capture - /x/capture/<action>

WHAT IT IS
----------
A drop-in button for an operator's own review screen. A human reviews an AI
output, clicks once, and the decision is sealed into the chain with who
reviewed it, on what device, against which inputs, and how long they took.

WHY IT IS TWO CALLS AND NOT ONE
-------------------------------
The obvious version is a single POST carrying a dwell time measured in the
browser. That number is the whole point - it is what makes rubber stamping
visible - and a number the reviewed party computes for itself is not
evidence. Anyone can set it to whatever looks diligent.

So the widget opens a case first. The server records the open time. When the
reviewer commits, the server computes the dwell itself from two timestamps it
owns. The browser never supplies the figure it is being judged on.

Same reason the verdict is withheld between the two calls: the machine's
answer is sealed at open and only returned at seal, so the chain shows the
human committed before they saw it. Ordering is the one thing that separates
judgement from agreement.

KEYS IN BROWSERS
----------------
An API key pasted into page JavaScript is public. Anyone reading the source
can post as that operator, forever.

So capture accepts a CAPTURE TOKEN: minted server-side by the operator from
their real key, bound to one origin, short-lived, and able to do exactly two
things - open a case and seal it. It cannot read records, cannot see other
cases, cannot touch any other module. Same idea as a publishable key.

The real API key still works for server-to-server calls. It should never
appear in a page.

DEVICES ARE THE BILLING UNIT
----------------------------
Every capture carries a device_id, and distinct devices per calendar month is
what billing is counted on. The registry here is that count: first seen, last
seen, events, per month. An operator can query their own figure at any time
and reconcile it against an invoice, rather than being told a number.

Device identifiers are hashed on arrival. The chain and the registry hold a
fingerprint, never the raw identifier.

    POST /x/capture/token     mint a browser-safe capture token (real key only)
    POST /x/capture/open      start a case, server records the clock
    POST /x/capture/seal      commit a verdict, server computes the dwell
    GET  /x/capture/devices   this month's billable device count
    GET  /x/capture/case?id=  the sealed record of one capture
    GET  /x/capture/summary   dwell and divergence across recent captures

"""
modules/codebase.py  -  dated evidence of what you held, and when
=================================================================

WHAT THIS IS, STATED HONESTLY FIRST
-----------------------------------
This does not prove ownership. Nothing cryptographic can. Ownership of
software is a legal fact established by authorship, company records and
signed assignment - not by a hash.

What it does produce is the evidence that decides most disputes about
software in practice: a dated, tamper-evident, externally anchored record
that a specific person held a specific body of code, in a specific form, at
a specific moment. When two parties later disagree about who had what
first, that is the question a court, a mediator or an investor actually
asks - and it is normally answered with commit dates, which are settable
fields that prove nothing.

This answers it with arithmetic instead.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
    POST /x/codebase/seal

Walks the deployed source tree, hashes every file, builds one manifest root
over all of them, and seals that root - together with a declaration of
authorship you supply - into the chain. From there it is anchored
externally and handed to peer chains like every other block.

Run it again next week and you get a second dated point. Run it on every
deploy and you accumulate a continuous, uneditable record of the codebase
evolving under your hand, which is a far stronger thing than a single
snapshot: a body of work with a history is much harder to dispute than a
file that appeared once.

WHAT THE MANIFEST CONTAINS - AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
-------------------------------------------------
For each file: its path and the SHA-256 of its exact bytes. Nothing else.
No contents leave the server, ever, by any route here. The hashes are
one-way, so the manifest reveals nothing about what the code does; it only
lets you demonstrate later that a file you hold now is byte-identical to
the file you held then.

The manifest route is deliberately KEYED rather than public. Only the root,
the file count and the total byte size are public. A public file listing
would hand an attacker a map of the deployment for no gain - the root is
all a third party needs in order to check a manifest you show them.

Excluded by default and never hashed: version control internals, caches,
databases, and anything that looks like a secret. Sealing a hash of your
own credentials file would be a poor way to protect them.

HOW YOU USE IT IN A DISPUTE
---------------------------
  1. You produce the sealed root, its block index, and the chain's
     external anchor.
  2. You produce your copy of the code.
  3. Anyone recomputes the manifest from your copy - the rules are
     published at /x/codebase/spec - and compares.

If it matches, you demonstrably held exactly that code no later than the
sealing time, and the record of it has not been altered since, because it
is a block in an anchored chain that peers also hold.

WHAT STILL HAS TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE THIS FILE
------------------------------------------
Stated plainly, because a module that let you believe it had settled your
legal position would be doing you harm:

  - Copyright arises on authorship. Sealing evidences it; it does not
    create or register it.
  - If a company operates the platform, the IP needs to sit with the right
    entity in writing, or the position is muddier than it looks.
  - Where two parties have collaborated, the only reliable answer is an
    agreement saying who owns what, signed before it matters rather than
    after.

This module makes the factual record unarguable. The legal position is a
separate job and needs a solicitor, not a hash.

    POST /x/codebase/seal      hash the tree, seal the root      (keyed)
    GET  /x/codebase/manifest  the full file list for a seal     (keyed)
    GET  /x/codebase/history   every seal, with root changes     (public)
    GET  /x/codebase/root      the latest sealed root            (public)
