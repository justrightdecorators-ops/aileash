sortition.py - selection by lot. The operator stops choosing who gets audited.

THE HOLE THIS FILLS
-------------------
Every system claiming human oversight reviews a sample of decisions. In
every one of them, the operator picks the sample. So the sample proves
nothing: you can review the easy ones, or the ones you already know are
clean, and nobody outside can tell the difference. It is the softest spot
in every Article 14 claim in the industry, and it has stayed soft because
there was no alternative.

There is one now. heartbeat.py seals a public beacon value on a cadence -
a number nobody, including the operator, can know before its tick. That is
a dice roll no one owns.

THE THREE LOCKS, IN ORDER. THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT.
--------------------------------------------------------
1. COMMIT THE POOL. Every record eligible for review in a period is
   listed, hashed into one pool digest, and sealed. The pool is now fixed.
2. WAIT FOR A TICK. The draw may only use a beacon value sealed AFTER the
   pool commit. This module refuses otherwise. So the pool was fixed
   before the dice existed, and cannot be edited once they do.
3. DRAW. The beacon value deterministically ranks the pool. The lowest k
   ranks are selected. Anyone can recompute it from public values.

Break any one and the sample is choosable again. Enforced here, not
promised.

WHAT IT CATCHES
---------------
A selected record with no review sealed against it is a permanent, visible
hole with a name on it. You cannot quietly skip an awkward case, because
the case was chosen for you in public, and its absence is the evidence.

Refusal is allowed and is not hidden - it is sealed as a refusal with a
reason. An honest refusal on the record is worth more than a silent gap.

THE SELECTION FUNCTION, PUBLISHED SO IT IS NOT OURS
---------------------------------------------------
  seed = SHA256("AILEASH-SORTITION-v1" | period | pool_digest | beacon_value)
  rank(i) = SHA256(seed | ":" | record_hash_i)
  selected = the k records with the lowest rank, ties by record hash

No random number generator, no language-specific behaviour, no library.
Ten lines in any language. A stranger recomputes it and either gets our
list or catches us.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
- It does not prove the reviews were any good. It proves nobody chose
  which ones happened.
- It does not stop an operator declining to draw at all. A period with no
  draw is a period with no sample, and /outstanding says so.
- Pool membership is asserted by this server. What stops a record being
  left out of the pool is complete.py, which commits the period's record
  count in advance - separate module, separate check.
- Selection is uniform. Risk-weighted sampling is deliberately not offered:
  a weighting the operator sets is a choice the operator made.

modules/sound.py  v2.0.0
Background music and button pops across sebbi.pro.

Arm after each deploy:  https://sebbi.pro/x/sound/status
(or everything at once:  https://sebbi.pro/x/arm/status)

What visitors get on every page:
  - Eight original tunes, two styles, rotating on their own:
      late-night guitar (clean plucked guitar with echo and chorus, bass
      guitar and sub, half-time beat) and chilled keys (Rhodes electric
      piano chords, plucked bass, laid-back swung drums, vinyl crackle).
    The guitar and bass are modelled plucked strings (Karplus-Strong), the
    piano is a Rhodes-style FM voice. Each tune has an intro that opens up,
    a drop, a breakdown and an outro, about two and a half minutes long.
    All generated live in the browser: no files to host, no licence to pay.
  - Real tracks: put audio files (mp3, m4a, ogg, wav) in modules/music/ in
    GitHub and the player plays those instead, shuffled. Leave the folder
    out and the built-in music plays.
  - A soft "pop" whenever a button or link is pressed.
  - A small music button under MY EARNINGS: play/pause, next, volume,
    pops on/off. Choices are remembered.
  - Starts on the visitor's first tap (browsers allow nothing before that),
    fades out while any video plays, pauses when the tab is hidden.

Nothing in server.py is edited.

"""
Live API specification - /x/spec

/api/spec is a hardcoded constant. It describes the API as it was when
somebody last remembered to update it, which is a documentation problem
pretending to be a feature.

This discovers what is actually loaded, right now, by reading the modules
directory and each module's own docstring. Add a module and the spec
updates itself. Delete one and it disappears. There is no separate list to
maintain and therefore no list that can drift.

That matters here more than it would elsewhere: a platform whose pitch is
"check it, don't trust it" should not ship a self-description that is
quietly out of date.

"""
modules/standard.py  -  the Ordering Test discovery document for this domain

WHAT IT SERVES
--------------
  GET /.well-known/ordering-test.json   this operator's discovery document
  GET /x/standard/hash                  sha256 of that document
  GET /x/standard/status                what is installed, and honest counts

SHAPE
-----
Deliberately identical to the shape Red Flag AI Pro published first:

    checks: { <name>: { supported, demonstrable_publicly, endpoint, note } }

Two fields, not one, and the second is the better idea. "We built it" and
"you can verify it without an account" are different claims, and most of this
market blurs them. Separating them lets a vendor be honest about having
something real that an outsider still has to take on trust.

WHAT THE HOST HEADER IS DOING HERE
----------------------------------
base_url is derived from the request rather than written into the file. An
earlier draft had the domain hardcoded, which meant any operator running it
would publish somebody else's domain as the source - the opposite of a mirror.
Deriving it means this file can be lifted to any domain and tells the truth
about wherever it is actually running.

EVERY PUBLISHED ENDPOINT MUST WORK AS WRITTEN
---------------------------------------------
An endpoint marked demonstrable_publicly is a promise that a stranger can copy
it out of this document and get an answer. If the route needs a parameter, the
document names that parameter. If a value has to be discovered first, the
document says where to discover it. An endpoint that errors when followed
literally is a failed check, not a documentation detail.

HONESTY RULES THIS FILE FOLLOWS
-------------------------------
  - A check we have not built says supported: false. It does not quietly go
    missing from the document.
  - A check that exists but needs an account says demonstrable_publicly:
    false, however much we would like the tick.
  - runner is null. A runner exists in draft, but the checks have not been
    jointly agreed with the other mirror, so publishing one as though it were
    a settled standard would claim something neither operator has earned yet.

None of that is modesty. A conformance document whose author scores full marks
on the day they publish it is a marketing page.
